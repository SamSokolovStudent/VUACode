This paper reports malformations diagnosed in ruminants, from 2000 to 2008, by the Veterinary Pathology Laboratory of the Federal University of Campina Grande, Patos, PB, in municipalities of the states of Paraiba, Pernambuco and Rio Grande do Norte. During the period, 47 (3.48%) out of 1.347 ascensions were reported as malformations. Based in the type of malformation and in the origin of the animals, malformations were divided in: 1) caused by the ingestion of M. tenuiflora, and 2) sporadic malformations of unknown causes. In sheep, 21 out of 418 ascensions were malformations, being 18 (4.3%) of malformations caused by M. tenuiflora and 3 (0.71%) of sporadic malformations. In cattle, 14 out of 434 ascensions were malformations, from these 8 (1.84%) were caused by M. tenuiflora and 6 (1.38%) were sporadic malformations. In goats, 12 out of 495 ascensions were malformations, being 9 (1.81%) malformations related with the ingestion of M. tenuiflora and 3 (0.6%) sporadic malformations. More frequent malformations caused by M. tenuiflora were arthrogryposis, micrognatia, palatoschisis, microphtalmia and unilateral or bilateral hypoplasia or aplasia of the incisive bones. Sporadic malformations were acephaly and hermaphrodite, dicephaly and malformations of mesenteric vessel in sheep; atresia ani in three goats; and hydranencephaly, atresia ani, ribs malformation with eventracion, cerebellar hypoplasia with hydrocephalus, pulmonary choristoma and meningocele, and siamese twins in cattle. A case of cerebellar hypoplasia with hydrocephalus was negative on immunohistochemistry to bovine viral diarrhea virus. Malformations caused by M. tenuiflora occurred during the whole year. The highest frequency in sheep seems to be associated with the consumption of the plant by ewes after first rains, in the first two months of gestation, when they are supplemented with concentrates, and M. tenuiflora is the main green forage available. Malformations occur mainly in degraded areas of native forest (caatinga) invaded by M. tenuiflora, with lesser variety of other species.", "year": 2010, "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://www.scielo.br/j/pvb/a/d8TfXtbRCp5vkMvnZCcHgHS/?lang=pt&format=pdf", "status": "GOLD"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "15091194", "name": "A.

As regards the other components, there were no significant differences among the animals. During the last years, we managed to collect the first-milked colostrum from five cattle after triplet-calving. The composition of these samples were determined by the methods we used earlier at twin-calving animals, and the results were compared to the colostrum composition of single- and twin-calving animals. It was found that although as an effect of triplet-calving the protein and IgG content of colostrum increased, the difference was not significant between twin- and triplet-calving animals. We are aware that others have not reported data from the point of view of the colostrum composition of twin-calving, and in the case of tripletcalving our results are unique in the world.

A dry period less than 40 d reduces milk yield in the subsequent lactation by 5 to 15%. Omitting the dry period completely has resulted in production losses of 20 to 40% in the subsequent lactation as a result of reduced mammary epithelial cell function rather than nutritional status or negative effects of exposure to milking stimulus and galactopoietic hormones during late gestation. There is limited information n a shortened dry period or continuous lactation using today\u2019s high-producing dairy cow. Further, the use of new management technologies and practices, such as bovine somatotropin, increased milking frequency, and altered photoperiod may improve mammary functionality in cows subjected to a shortened or omitted dry period. Recent research suggests potential for reducing the dry period requirement to 30 d regardless of parity and for continuous milking in bST-supplemented, multiparous cows without production losses in the subsequent lactation. Further, a reduction in dry period length has resulted in improved dry matter intake in periparturient cows and may improve milk yield and health status of transition cows. Introduction The dry period between lactations has been a standard in dairy management practices since the 1800s (Dix Arnold and Becker, 1936). However the optimal length ranged from 10 d to 10 wks. In the early 1900s, an 8-wk dry period became the most widely used because it was believed to result in optimal productivity in the subsequent lactation (Dix Arnold and Becker, 1936). During World War II, the 305-d lactation and 60-d dry period was adopted for both maximal milk production during a time of food shortages and maintenance of genetic progress (Knight, 1998). Since adoption of the 60-d dry period, the dairy industry has undergone many advances in management practices and embraced new technologies, such as artificial insemination, total mixed rations, increased milking frequency (IMF), bovine somatotropin (bST), and altered photoperiod, resulting in production increases of 5000 kg or more per lactation through improved peak milk yields and more persistent lactations. Despite these advances, more than 70% of U.S. dairies are still managing for a 60-d dry period (NAHMS, 1996) and the optimal dry period length has not been reevaluated until recently. Further, previous research on the optimal dry period length in dairy cattle was conducted using cows producing peak milk yields of 25 kg/d or less compared to today\u2019s dairy cow capable of reaching peak milk yields in excess of 50 kg/d. Effects of dry period length on subsequent milk yield A review of the literature reveals production losses of 10 to 38% in cows subjected to a shortened or omitted dry period (R\u00e9mond et al., 1997; Bachman and Schairer, 2003; Annen2 et al., 2004). These data were summarized from both planned experiments and retrospective analyses of dairy records. Analyses of dairy records may be biased by incorrect records, missed breeding dates, multiple births, aborted pregnancies, and mismanagement resulting in a short or no dry period in cows that were being managed for a 60-d dry period. These factors would negatively impact milk yield in the subsequent lactation regardless of dry period length. Results from commercial trials and controlled experiments on shortened or omitted dry periods are summarized in Table 1. From these planned experiments, four hypotheses on the dry period requirement in dairy cattle were proposed. They are 1) replenishment of body reserves, 2) negative effects of galactopoietic and milking stimulus hormones, 3) reduced mammary cell number, and 4) reduction of normal mammary function (Swanson, 1965; Smith et al., 1967; Swanson et al., 1967; Capuco et al., 1997). The nutritional hypothesis was disproved in an experiment using identical twins to test the effects of dry period length on body weight during late gestation and the subsequent lactation (Swanson, 1965). The twins had equivalent milk yields during their first lactation, at the end of which one twin was dried 60 d prior to their expected parturition date and the other twin was milked continuously (no dry period; CM). Body weight (BW) was measured weekly throughout the experiment. The CM twins produced only 75% and 62% as much as controls (60-d dry period) during their second and third lactations, respectively. The CM twins maintained heavier BWs than controls throughout the experiment, indicating nutrition was not the limiting factor to milk yield in the subsequent lactation. If nutrition had been the limiting factor, the higher BWs reported for CM cows should have supported higher, not lower, milk yields than controls. After the third lactation all twins were given a 60-d dry period. There were no notable carryover effects of continuous milking during the fourth lactation, as the twins that were previously CM had a tendency to produce more milk than the control twins. The absence of a carryover effect from continuous milking has also been demonstrated by Coppock et al. (1974) and R\u00e9mond et al. (1997). A half-udder model was used to further negate the nutritional hypothesis (Smith et al., 1967). In this model, one udder half is dried for 60 d and the other half milked continuously. Variation between experimental units is reduced because all factors other than lactation status are common to the udder halves, including nutritional and endocrine factors. Despite common nutrient supply to both udder halves, CM halves produced 77% as much milk as 60-d dry halves in the succeeding lactation. Endocrine hormones associated with the milking stimulus and galactopoiesis were also common to both halves, but 60-d dry halves produced higher milk yields in the next lactation indicating that exposure to these hormones during the dry period did not limit milk yield in the halves given a dry period (Smith et al., 1967). Autocrine and paracrine hormones in the mammary gland may play a role in milk yield reductions in CM halves, but have not been investigated. In cows given a 60-d dry period, mammary gland involution occurs during the early dry period and is characterized by 1) increased programmed cell death (apoptosis), 2) increased intramammary pressure and udder distention, 3) regression of secretory function of mammary epithelial cells (MEC), and 4) low levels of MEC proliferation (growth; Holst et al., 1987; Capuco and Akers, 1999; Annen1 et al., 2003). Concurrent pregnancy and advanced lactation at the time of milk stasis (dry-off) in dairy cows results in a rapid, but small increases in MEC apoptosis during involution and maintenance of alveolar structure and integrity occur throughout the dry period (Annen1 et al., 2003). By 25 d after dry-off, mammary DNA content (cell number) and luminal area of the alveoli are at a minimum and stromal components of the mammary gland are at a maximum, suggesting mammary involution is complete (Capuco et al., 1997). This time point also appears to correspond to initiation of the process to replace MEC that were removed by apoptosis and/or contributes to continued mammary development. After the gland has been dry for 25 d, an increase in MEC proliferation occurs and the rate of proliferation increases throughout the remainder of the dry period. By d 53 of the dry period (1 wk prepartum in cows managed for a 60-d dry period), MEC proliferation has nearly doubled compared to values on day 7 of the dry period (Capuco et al., 1997). The second stage of lactogenesis, when MEC proliferation is greatest and differentiation into a secretory phenotype occurs, also takes place during the last week of gestation (Akers, 2002). Interestingly, maintenance of lactation during the last 60 d of gestation in CM cows alters these patterns of MEC proliferation (Capuco et al., 1997). In both half-udder and between animal experiments in dairy cows, mammary DNA content and parenchyma mass was the same in dry and CM glands (no change in total MEC number; Swanson et al., 1967; Capuco et al., 1997), but MEC proliferation is reduced in CM glands (Capuco et al., 1997). Maintenance of total cell number despite dramatic reductions (80%) in MEC proliferation, suggests an alteration in mammary cell turnover that would result in less replacement of old or senescent MEC during late gestation. If old MEC have reduced secretory and mitotic capacity (Capuco and Akers, 1999), this change in MEC turnover which increases carryover of old MEC into the subsequent lactation may be the causative factor of reduced mammary functionality in CM cows (Capuco et al., 1997). An increase in MEC carryover into the next lactation has been demonstrated in CM rats (Pitkow et al., 1972). Reduced mammary functionality and possibly reduced MEC number in cows subjected to a shortened or omitted dry period could potentially be alleviated by use of management practices that improve these factors, thus altering the dry period requirement in today\u2019s dairy cows. There are three dairy management practices that alter mammary gland functionality and/or cell number: 1) bST, 2) IMF, and 3) altered photoperiod. Recent research, some of which incorporates bST supplementation and IMF, has demonstrated potential for reducing dry period length in high-producing cows. Several studies have recently demonstrated that a 30-d dry period is equal to a 60-d dry period with (Gulay et al., 2003; Annen3 et al., 2004) or without (Bachman, 2002; Rastani et al., 2003) bST supplementation during late gestation and early lactation. Bachman (2002) evaluated the decline in replacement of senescent MEC and reduced milk yield in the subsequent lactation using a shortened dry period (30 d) and estrogen injection at milk stasis to attempt to hasten involution. Results demonstrated that 305-d ME milk yields in the subsequent lactation were equal in 30-d dry and 60-d dry grou", "year": 2004, "openAccessPdf": null, "authors": [{"authorId": "11432301", "name": "E.

Some of these techniques include the in vitro maturation (IVM) and IVF of oocytes, sperm sexing and embryo transfer (ET) to recipient females to obtain pregnancies and offspring. These modern assisted-reproduction techniques (ART) can help produce twin pregnancies and calving of a pre-determined sex. The aim of this study was to produce a high proportion of female bovine embryos in vitro using X-chromosome-selected sexed semen and to transfer them in pairs to recipient females, in order to evaluate the efficiency of transferring two female embryos in both cows and heifers. Cebu-cross ovaries were obtained from a local slaughterhouse and transported to a nearby laboratory in Chiapas, Mexico, to obtain cumulus-oocyte complexes by follicular aspiration and culture in maturation medium for 24\u2009h. For IVF, frozen X-sorted semen (Milking Gyr and Holstein breeds, 90% purity, Sexing Technologies, Navasota, TX, USA) was used. Gametes were co-incubated for 22\u2009h, then moved to embryo development medium and cultured for 7 days. Recipient Cebu-cross commercial cows (n\u2009=\u200998) and heifers (n\u2009=\u200950) were synchronized, using intravaginal devices impregnated with progesterone, administering eCG and prostaglandin at withdrawal. Seven days after heat, 88 recipients were subjected to non-surgical ET (59 cows and 29 heifers). Embryo transfers were performed in Tamaulipas and Veracruz, Mexico, and were divided into 2 groups: A) cows, and B) heifers. Only grade-1 embryos were selected for ET. Two embryos were loaded in a single 0.25\u2009mL French straw and transferred to the uterine horn ipsilateral to the ovary with a corpus luteum. Pregnancy diagnosis was performed by ultrasound or rectal palpation 60 days after ET. A Fisher's exact test (SPSS v. 16.0, SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) was used to determine statistical differences (\u03b1\u2009=\u20090.05). Of IVF oocytes, 176/180 (98%) and 242/300 (81%) were fertilized, producing 96/180 (53.3%) Milking Gyr (semen)-Cebu (oocytes) and 92/300 (30.7%) Holstein (semen)-Cebu (oocytes) grade-1 embryos, respectively. Of the 88 recipients, 33 were pregnant (37.5%), however, it was not possible (at that time) to determine the number and sex of fetuses developing in utero. Overall, 8 of the 29 heifers were pregnant (27.6%), compared to 25 pregnancies in 59 cows (42.4%). For heifers, the pregnancy results for transferring Milking Gyr-Cebu embryos (4/11) versus Holstein-Cebu embryos (4/18) were not significantly different (P\u2009=\u20090.433, two-tailed Fisher's exact test). A similar comparison could not be made for cows given smaller sample sizes due to the extra variable of having taken place on several different ranches (n\u2009=\u200911). The concept herein is that smaller twin female crossbred calves may reduce issues associated with freemartinism and dystocia while still maintaining the vigor of crossbred offspring.

Dystocia together with other problems like stillbirth, pregnancy toxaemia, mastitis, orchitis are among the most common reproductive conditions affecting these animals apart from disease and poor nutrition. This paper was designed as a retrospective study on the incidence and causes of dystocia in sheep and goats over a six months period June, 2015 to November, 2015. A total of 142 cases of dystocia were recorded at the clinic over the period of the review out of which 110 (77.46%) cases were in sheep while 32 (22.54%) occurred in goats. The principal causes of dystocia in both sheep and goats were fetal malpresentation and twinning with 25.45% and 23.62% respectively. Other causes included ringworm, fetal oversize, and monsters and prolapse. Various methods were employed in managing dystocia and included manual traction, caesarian section as well as drugs. It was concluded that dystocia was a major reproductive problem in small ruminants and management of the condition must be improved to save the pregnant animals and their young ones.", "year": 2017, "openAccessPdf": null, "authors": [{"authorId": "2107232897", "name": "A.

There are significant breed differences in the relation between age of the cows, measured in parities, and the frequency of monozygous (MZ) as well as dizygous (DZ) twin births. On an average, the DZ frequency increases more than the MZ frequency from the first to the fourth-fifth calving; then the age-curves show a plateauing tendency. After the first twin birth, the twinning frequency at the following calvings is 4\u20135 times higher than in the general population.

Charles Darwin's notion that the profligacy of women led to reduced fertility gained plausibility with the subsequent discovery of the auto- and alloantigenicity of spermatozoa and of testicular material. From this observation arose the reasonable expectation that immunological control of fertility may be feasible. Discovery of the importance of natural transfer of immunity from mother to offspring, the ontogeny of the immune response and recognition that pregnancy is an almost consistently successful violation of the \"laws of transplantation\" are only a few highlights or components of the burgeoning, multifaceted field we have come to recognize as the immunology of reproduction. An overview of this subject will be presented with regard to its evolutionary origins, its accomplishments, its current trends and some of its potentialities. The immunology of reproduction has not developed in isolation; in recent years it has benefited enormously from developments in other fields, and in its turn it has exerted its own impact on other disciplines, especially on transplantation.

Quantifying these losses under grazing conditions has been a difficult task, and has involved the use of \"twin pastures\" with one pasture containing parasitized cattle and the other pasture with cattle that are kept free of nematode parasites. For this reason, losses from these parasites in South Dakota can only be estimated based upon a few other studies conducted in neighboring states. The purpose of this project was to develop an inexpensive and easy \"single-pasture\" method to measure production losses from internal nematodes in cow-calf pairs during the summer grazing season. Four cattle herds from a single cattle producer in eastern Brookings County were selected for this study. The four herds consisted of 320 Angus and cross-bred Angus cow-calf pairs grazed on four separate pastures. The ages of the cows and the stocking density differed slightly among each of the herds. The study started during the second week in June, and ended approximately 100 days later. Within each herd, approximately 10% of the cows-calves pairs were injected with the recommended dosage of Dectomax (Pfizer Animal Health, Inc.) three times during study period to protect them from intestinal nematode. The remaining pairs served to keep larval nematode pasture levels high and also served as the group controls. Cow and calf weight gains and cow pregnancy rates were determined at the end of the study, and multiple regression analysis was used to separate out known confounders such as pasture conditions, calf gender and calf starting weight. After controlling for these confounders, steer calves from the treated pairs gained 18 pounds more than paired calves from the untreated group, and heifer calves from the treated pairs gained 14 pounds more than those in the untreated group (p= 0.02). These weights are a valid estimate of the losses due solely to internal parasites in these cattle, since all other variables within each herd (e.g. pasture condition and external parasite pressure) were equal. Pregnancy rates between the two groups were not significantly different.", "year": 1999, "openAccessPdf": null, "authors": [{"authorId": "39468952", "name": "K.

In the present study twelve DSD heifers which were single born (singletons) and culled due to the abnormal development of internal genitalia were studied using cytogenetic and molecular tech - niques.

An internet-based registration of pregnancy course, outcome and offspring after transfer of blastocysts in the human Jansen C.A.M., Tucker K.E. and Rijnders P.M. Depertment of IVF, Reinier de Graafgroep, loco Diaconessenhuis Voorburg, The Netherlands Introduction: The transfer of blastocysts on day 5 in human in-vitro fertilization (IVF) has become increasingly important, especially for patients with many embryos from which to choose on day 2 or 3. New sequential media may, in part, overcome the problems associated with the longer duration of culture necessary for blastocyst formation. Little is known, however, concerning the offspring resulting from the transfer of blastocysts. In other species, e.g. cattle, in-vitro production and transfer of blastocysts can lead to an increased incidence of birth defects. In the human, we have reported an unexpected increase in the rate of monozygotic twinning, which might be related to splitting of the inner cell mass during the process of 'figure eight' blastocyst formation. Along with other centres, we have also noted an increase in the ratio of boys to girls of ,-,60:40. Based on these data, it seems imperative, therefore, to closely monitor the course and outcome of pregnancies obtained from these techniques with extensive follow-up. Methods: For the purpose of follow-up we have created an internet-based registry which is now accessible through the ESHRE site \u00abFIELD HYPERLINK> <'www.eshre.com' =Fwww.eshre.com\u00bb. Registration is required in advance and a form for that purpose is available on the web-site. All participants will have a unique username and password. Currently, however, it is still possible to access the web site by using 'demo' as both the username and the password. All data can be entered online. A minimum of two forms needs to be completed; one form requires information regarding culture conditions and the other poses questions concerning pregnancy course and outcome. The amount of information in the latter form is arranged according to three levels of detail. These are 'entry level', 'advanced level' and 'expert level'. All participants will be requested to fill in at least one of these three forms. All data are expressed in relation to the year of transfer and to the culture conditions. Therefore, if conditions change during any year, this information needs to be entered more than once for that particular year. Results: To date, 22 centres, representing 13 countries, have agreed to participate in the registry and, in total, they are responsible for over 2000 pregnancies resulting from blastocyst transfer. The results of these data will be presented on the web site. 204 Conclusion: The necessity for global registration of the outcome of blastocyst transfer is widely recognized and accepted. The internet offers an unequalled forum through which data can be entered on-line and reach all parts of the world. It is envisaged that a large body of meaningful data will be available soon, not only highlighting the advantages of this technique, but also enabling us to make more founded decisions regarding the risks and benefits of blastocyst transfer. P-126. Is there justification for ICSI after just one total fertilization failure in IVF? van Woerkom-Blik A., van den Berg A. and Jansen C.A.M. Department of IVF, Reinier de Graaf groep, loco Diaconessenhuis Voorburg, The Netherlands Introduction: Total fertilization failure (TFF) in in-vitro fertilization (IVF) may occur as a result of a multitude of factors. Some of these may potentially be solved by intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI), such as those related to the acrosome reaction or to zona pellucida binding. Alternately, this treatment offers no obvious benefit for cases involving poor oocyte quality or huge fluctuations in culture conditions It has been shown that, whilst ICSI still has some inherent drawbacks, it can be a solution for patients with severe sperm defects. Unfortunately it offers no substantial advantage when used as a first treatment for patients with 'tubal factor only' infertility. The criteria for when ICSI should be performed instead of IVF however, have not been properly defined. Once TFF has occurred there is a natural tendency to resort to ICSI in the second cycle, although restrictive regulations in The Netherlands only allow us to perform ICSI after two previous TFF. Methods: In an effort to determine the limits at which ICSI will offer an advantage over conventional IVF in patients with prior TFF, we performed a prospective study over two years in which patients with one TFF were included. Patients were selected based on prognostic criteria such as stimulation parameters, oocyte yield and aspects of sperm quality. The oocytes from each patient were randomized between ICSI and IVF. In order to determine if a selection bias was present, we also analysed the remainder of patients that had a second cycle after TFF. A total of 32 patients were included in this study, of which 11 patients were selected for half IVFI half ICSI (Group A). The remaining 21 patients received IVF only (Group B).

Exercise, genetics, calf birth weight, calf sex, nutrition, cow body weight at calving, gestation length, season and cow age at calving are the main predisposing factors. The maternal causes resul from comprised feto-maternal disproportion, improper cervical dilation and failure of uterine expulsive force, uterine torsion and hernia of gravid uterus and fetal causes such as fetal oversize, fetal mal-dispositions, twinning and fetal diseases. Dystocia has a chief economic impact on cow-calf producers. It has a direct negative impact on calves due to the death of calves and cows, losses production in both the cow and calf and delayed reproduction rates. Reduction in milk yield, increased cost of treatment and indirect costs, such as an increase in the risk of subsequent unfavorable health events and an increase in culling rate are another consequence of dystocia. The incidence of dystocia can be reduced by applying sound management of heifers and cows which includes avoiding confinement method, proper nutritional management of cows during pregnancy, removal of heifers with small pelvic areas and selecting sires for calving ease. Diagnostic management based on history, physical examination as well as vaginal and rectal specific examination and medical management by specific ecobolic drugs as a treatment and obstetrical approaches like forced extraction, mutation, fetotomy and cesarean section are the other ways for proper management of dystocia in dairy cattle.", "year": 2018, "openAccessPdf": null, "authors": [{"authorId": "2182581290", "name": "Roba Assefa"}]}

The relationship between the appearance of these cells in the blood of immune cattle under challenge and the clearance of infection suggests that they are involved in the control of infection, but direct evidence is lacking that CTL can mediate protection. We have made a quantitative kinetic study of CTL responses in lymph originating from infected lymph nodes in a number of immune cattle under challenge with T. parva. Direct killing activity and the frequency of CTL precursors (CTLp) within responding cell populations were evaluated. A substantial increase in the proportion of CD8+ CTL was observed between days 8 and 11 after challenge. Frequencies of CTLp as high as 1:32 were observed and activity was essentially confined to the large blasting cell fraction. The analogous response in peripheral blood was of lower magnitude and delayed by 1-2 days. The high frequency of CTLp in efferent lymph permitted the adoptive transfer of this activity between immune and naive monozygotic twin calves. In separate experiments, naive calves lethally infected with T. parva were protected by inoculation of up to 10(10) responding CD8+ T cells derived from their immune twins.

The objective of the study was to use a model to identify the relative roles of reproductive, genetic, and nutritional management in minimizing beef production systems' environmental impact in an economically viable, socially acceptable manner. An economic and environmental diet optimizer was used to identify ideal nutritional management of beef production systems varying in genetic and reproductive technology use. Eight management scenarios were compared to a least cost baseline: average U.S. production practices (CON), CON with variable nutritional management (NUT), twinning cattle (TWN), early weaning (EW), sire selection by EPD using either on-farm bulls (EPD-B) or AI (EPD-AI), decreasing the calving window (CW), or selecting bulls by EPD and reducing the calving window (EPD-CW). Diets to minimize land use, water use, and/or greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions were optimized under each scenario. Increases in diet cost attributable to reducing environmental impact were constrained to less than stakeholder willingness to pay for improved efficiency and reduced environmental impact. Baseline land use, water use, and GHG emissions were 188 m, 712 L, and 21.9 kg/kg HCW beef. The NUT scenario, which assessed opportunities to improve sustainability by altering nutritional management alone, resulted in a simultaneous 1.5% reduction in land use, water use, and GHG emissions. The CW scenario improved calf uniformity and simultaneously decreased land use, water use, and GHG emissions by 3.2%. Twinning resulted in a 9.2% reduction in the 3 environmental impact metrics. The EW scenario allowed for an 8.5% reduction in the 3 metrics. The EPD-AI scenario resulted in an 11.1% reduction, which was comparable to the 11.3% reduction achieved by EPD-B in the 3 metrics. Improving genetic selection by using AI or by purchasing on-farm bulls based on their superior EPD demonstrated clear opportunity to improve sustainability.

Aims The study was designed to estimate genetic parameters for twinning rate (TR) and to estimate genetic correlations between twinning rate and production and reproductive performances in the first lactation of Iranian Holstein cows. Methods The dataset used in this study was collected by the Animal Breeding Center of Iran during 1991\u20132013 and consisted of 273\u2009742 records of calving type (singleton or twin), 435\u2009742 records of 305-day milk yield, 424\u2009175 records of milk fat percentage, 253\u2009901 records of milk protein percentage, 251\u2009558 records of first calving interval, and 153\u2009632 records of number of days to first service. A single Gibbs sampling chain with 500\u2009000 rounds was generated to run linear and threshold animal models. Key results Posterior mean estimates of heritabilities for traits were: TR 0.0028, milk yield 0.28, milk fat percentage 0.33, milk protein percentage 0.38, first calving interval 0.064, and days to first service 0.061. Genetic correlations between TR and performance traits were negligible and varied from \u20130.08 (between TR and milk yield) to 0.04 (between TR and protein percentage). Conclusions Diminishing TR by genetic selection is a slow task owing to its low heritability. Negligible genetic correlation between TR and performance traits suggests that selection for decreased TR would not cause a significant decrease in milk production, nor is it likely to have a negative impact on the reproductive performance of dairy cows. Implications Dairy cattle breeders should follow genetic selection programs, especially for milk-production traits, without concern for an increase in twinning rate.", "year": 2020, "openAccessPdf": null, "authors": [{"authorId": "2128306873", "name": "Seyedeh Samaneh Asadollahi"}, {"authorId": "1401754993", "name": "N.

During the mid-twentieth century, devil worship was seen as merely an isolated practice of medieval times. But by the early 1980s, many influential experts in clinical medicine and in law enforcement were proclaiming that satanic cults were widespread and dangerous. By examining the broader context for alleged \"cult\" activity, Bill Ellis demonstrates how the image of contemporary Satanism emerged during the 1970s. Blaming a wide range of mental and physical illnesses on in-dwelling demons, a faction of the Pentecostal movement became convinced that their gifts of the spirit were being opposed by satanic activities. They attributed these activities to a \"cult\" that was the evil twin of true Christianity. In some of the cases Ellis considers, common folk beliefs and rituals were misunderstood as evidence of devil worship. In others, narratives and rituals themselves were used to combat satanic forces. As the media found such stories more and more attractive, any activity with even remotely occult overtones was demonized in order to fit a model of absolute good confronting evil. Ellis's wide-ranging investigation covers ouija boards, cattle mutilation, graveyard desecration, and \"diabolical medicine\"--the psychiatric community's version of exorcism. He offers a balanced view of contentious issues such as demonic possession, satanic ritual abuse, and the testimonies of confessing \"ex-Satanists.\" A trained folklorist, Ellis seeks to navigate a middle road in this dialog, and his insights into informal religious traditions clarify how the image of Satanism both explained and created deviant behavior.", "year": 2000, "openAccessPdf": null, "authors": [{"authorId": "47244349", "name": "B.

RESEARCHES ON THE REPRODUCTIVE CHARACTERISTICS OF SIMMENTAL CATTLE IN COMMERCIAL FARMS IN KAYSERI ABSTRACT The study was carried out to investigate the reproductive characteristics of Simmental cattle which were imported from Germany and raised in commercial farm conditions in Kayseri. As the study was conducted in various farms a common care and feeding program could not be applied. In the statistical analysis of data, x2-test for ratios, Duncan-test for the comparisons of mean values in groups of these data were used in GLM procedure in SAS program. In the Simmental cattle in the study gestation rate was 96.0%; no abortion was observed and twinning rate was 4.2%. First gestation and calving age was 20.67 and 29.98 months, number of inseminations was 1.94, gestation length was 282.55 days, open period was 95.49 days, calving interval was 377.74 days.

Animals feature prominently in cosmogonic myths by conveying the sacred power and messages with which the primordial chaos was transformed into the habitable cosmos. As shown in totemic ideas and practices, animals play key roles in identity construction of individuals, clans, and ethnic groups. The role of cattle in the religious thought and practices of pastoralists is examined. Cattle are seen as an extension of the human family and they represent several ideals that the human community espouses. The ideology and rituals of sacred kingship portray animal symbols. From the ancient Ashanti kingdom in Ghana to the Dande villages in Zimbabwe, animal metaphors convey the power of the king and royal ancestors.

Two models were used in this study: a linear sire model and a binary threshold-logit sire model. Both were mixed models considering fixed effects and random effects. Analyses were conducted using a restricted maximum likelihood method. Heritability estimates were 0.0192 \u00b1 0.0009 and 0.1420 \u00b1 0.0069 for the linear and threshold models, respectively. Repeatabilities from the linear and threshold-logit models were 0.0443 \u00b1 0.0012 and 0.2310 \u00b1 0.0072, respectively.

Dormant primordial follicles become active and undergo progressive development at regular intervals commencing during the late fetal stage and continuing throughout adulthood. Once activated, follicles and oocytes in a cohort either grow to maturation and ovulation or undergo atresia, ultimately depleting the ovaries of germ cells. It takes an estimated 100 days for a follicle and its oocyte to reach the mature ovulatory stage. Within an individual, number of follicles in one ovary is similar to number in the other ovary; however, there are large differences among individuals in total number of follicles present in both ovaries. In follicles that are recruited into the preovulatory pool, the fluid filled antrum enlarges and growth can be monitored by ultrasonography. Preovulatory follicles grow in waves rather than in a continuous stream, and number of follicles detected in a wave is related positively to number of microscopic follicles populating the ovarian cortex. Number of follicles in a wave is highly repeatable and the estimated heritability of number of follicles in heifers is approximately 0.35. Monitoring preovulatory follicle numbers by ultrasonography can be used to identify females that produce more embryos following superovulation or more natural twin births. Number of follicles in a wave can be influenced by energy balance and exogenous hormones, and quality of oocytes within those follicles can be influenced environmental factors, hormones and vitamins.

Improving reproductive efficiency helps to maintain the maximal number of cows producing milk at optimal levels. Reproductive efficiency in dairy cattle currently is suboptimal primarily due to four factors: 1) poor detection and expression of estrus behavior, 2) a high incidence of anovular cows near the end of the voluntary waiting period, 3) poor conception rates of lactating cows, and 4) a high incidence of pregnancy loss for cows that conceive. Over the past decade, the development of hormonal protocols that synchronize follicular development, luteal regression, and ovulation thereby allowing for timed AI without the need to rely on visual estrus detection has helped to overcome factor 1 and to some extent factor 2 above, and development of systematic resynchronization systems for cows failing to conceive to an AI service is underway. Regarding factor 3, the body of scientific literature supports the notion that fertility of lactating dairy cows has decreased over the past 50 years. Factor 3 is closely related to factor 4 because fertility assessed at any point during pregnancy is a function of both conception rate and pregnancy loss. Development of strategies that reduce the rate of embryonic loss after AI will therefore result in an increase in conception rate. A final factor that negatively affects reproduction in dairy cattle is twinning, and the observation that twinning has increased in dairy cattle over time suggests a concurrent change in one or more of these causative factors during this same period. Management strategies need to be developed to avoid or mitigate the negative effects of twinning in dairy herds, especially if twinning rates continue to increase. Future development of reproductive management strategies during the next decade must be focused on both the applied and basic aspects of understanding and overcoming the limitations imposed by these factors.", "year": 2014, "openAccessPdf": null, "authors": [{"authorId": "2469217", "name": "P.

Twinning is an important non-infectious cause of pregnancy loss in mares and should not occur on well-managed breeding farms. The equine uterus is not well designed to carry twins, as the entire endometrial surface is required for the placental development of a single fetus. The membrane shared between two vesicles does not function as a nutrient supply and therefore cannot fulfill the nutritional requirements of both fetuses, which eventually causes abortion of one or both of them during mid- to late gestation. This can result in considerable economic loss to the equine breeding industry.

The 2nd objective of this study was to describe prepartum and postpartum serum concentrations of other relevant blood parameters and their associations with dystocia risk. Initially, 200 Holstein and 65 Holstein x Black home crosbreed cows, aged 3-8 year, were selected for this study. Samples were taken both in the 7th month of pregnancy and within the first 15 min postpartum. At the end of pregnancy, the cows were divided into two groups according to the type of birth: Difficult labour and normal labour. PON1 activities measured in the prepartum samples were significantly higher than in postpartum samples from cows which had normal or difficult labour. Although, PON1 activity from cows with dystocia was lower both pre-and postpartum, this difference did not reach statistical significance. Furthermore, there was a tendency to decreased PON1 activities in the case of absolute birth weight and twins. Evaluation of cholesterol, HDL-C, LDL-C, albumin, globulin and alkaline phosphatase levels does not appear to be useful in the assessment of dystocia. However, increased serum creatine kinase and creatine kinase isoenzyme MB may be a parameter which could be used in diagnosing dytocia in pregnancy.", "year": 2008, "openAccessPdf": null, "authors": [{"authorId": "74284087", "name": "S.

TCM-199 supplemented with 5% calf serum (CS), Brackett-Oliphant solution supplemented with 10\u2009mg\u2009mL\u22121 BSA, and CR1aa containing 5% CS, were used for each culture step: in vitro maturation, fertilization, and culture (IVM,IVF, and IVC). Two-cell stage embryos were obtained 24 to 27\u2009h post-insemination. Zonae pellucidae were removed by exposure to 0.25% pronase. Then, embryos were separated into blastomeres by gentle pipetting in IVC medium. Each blastomere was introduced into a single conical microwell of 25 wells, each having a diameter and depth of ~287\u2009\u03bcm and 168\u2009\u03bcm (Dai Nippon Printing, Tokyo, Japan).

Rather, it seems an odd patchwork of functions. Life-threatening allergic reactions occur alongside live-preserving immunity through vaccination. There is inflammation, identification of cancerous cells and removal of dead cell material. The apparent lack of coherence in this hodgepodge of roles certainly adds to the challenge of teaching about the immune system. To express unity in the suite of functions, many biologists adopted the dual notion of 'self' and 'non-self'. In this view, the immune system fundamentally discriminates between the body's own proper functioning cells ('self') and foreign pathogens, toxins, renegade cells and waste fragments (all 'non-self'). It then triggers an appropriate response \u2014 sometimes narrowly targeted, sometimes broad; sometimes local, sometimes systemic. By exploring the history of the concept one might clarify (towards more fruitful teaching) just what an 'immune self' means. One may wonder, too, given the apparent chaos and diversity of immune responses, how scientists ever developed an effective concept. Tracing the origins of our understanding takes one back and forth through history. One encounters several Nobel-prize winning discoveries, as well as many apparently insignificant details. The excursion can provide deeper perspective on scientific practice, often hidden by the polished textbook concepts. Tolerance and the Non-Nonself The concept of self ultimately emerged from an unlikely source. Ray Owen grew up on a farm. In graduate school, he turned to the genetics of blood type in cattle. In 1945, he studied a case of fraternal twins. In Mendelian terms, individuals with distinct fathers should exhibit unique blood types. Yet here, Owen found, each twin could accept blood transfusions from the other. They shared blood type! Owen noted that they could carry each other's antigens because in cattle such twins share placental circulation. Their blood type thus resulted from development, not solely genetics. Owen's observation gained further significance through Frank Macfarlane Burnet, a physician thinking about how antibodies are produced. Burnet saw here a general feature of immune systems. Each twin had acquired what he called tolerance to the other's antigens. At a critical early stage, organisms might not yet recognize the potential antigens as 'non-self'. Later, they would accommodate the already introduced antigens as 'self'. The idea echoed the concept", "year": 2005, "openAccessPdf": null, "authors": [{"authorId": "48546539", "name": "D.

The Analysis of the ethnic-related conflicts all over the word has proven to be a very difficult enterprise. The issues of ethnicity in Nigeria and Tafawa Balewa in particular have created conditions for the initiation and resurgence of conflicts. The 1991, 1995 and 1998 conflicts in Tafawa Balewa have left an aimost indelible mark on inter ethnic relations in the state. For example in 1991, 500 people were officially reported killed and 34, 000 others rendered homeless. In 1995 the resurgence of conflict left about 1, 400 people kil led and 38 vdlages and 77 churches destroyed. The issues relating to these conflicts, for example, the question of citizenship and identity, particularly, the issues of a separate chiefdom for the Sayawa ethnic group have remained almost total ly unresolved. The historical development of the ethnic question in Tafawa Balewa is aimed at identifying the specific basis of antagonistic relations between the HausaFulani on the one hand and the Sayawa ethnic group on the other. Introduction The literature of recent years on political development in Africa gives a prominent place to the twin themes of ethnicity and ethnic conflicts. These issues have accordingly dominated academic research (see for example, Egwu 1998, 1999; Otiti 1999; Osagie; 1994 Nnolt 1978; Ake 1993). Ethnic conflicts pose fundamental threat to political stability and national integration especially in plural societies of Africa. In particular, the resurgence of ethnic entities in parts of Nigeria, Rwanda Liberia and so on, have led to state collapse and huge human and material destruction. For example, in Zangon kataf in Kaduna State of Nigeria, two days of intensive ethnic violence between the Katafs and the HausaFulani in 1996 resulted in mass k i l l ings and destruction of properties of inestimable value. The protracted Ife/Modakeke Communal strife, Ofa-Ibeku disturbances of September. 1998, the age-long Urhobo / Itsekin and Ijaw communal strife have also left huge human and material loses. The list which has become legendry also include the ten year old depute between Garbawa and Dala villages in Yobe State in which 5 people were ki l led in 1992; the Kaduna ethnic/religious crisis of 2000, as well as the age long ethnic feud between the Jukun and Tiv communities. All of these have led to the redefinition of ethnic relations in these areas. The resurgence of ethnic identity and conflicts in Nigeria could be attributed to many factors.Some of these factors mclude.|The colonial heritage, the post colonial economic conditions in the country with struggle over scarce resources particularly after the introduction of the structural adjustment programme. Others may include the emerging democratization processes; the pattern of class formation and its consequences on the distribution of the nations wealth, the weak nature of the state, and the citizenship question. The focus of this paper is the historical development of the ethnic question in Tafawa Balewa area of Bauchi metropolis. The recent political development, particularly the local government creation in 1997, split the Tafawa Balewa local government into two, namely, Tafawa Balewa and Bogoro. The entire area was called Lere district during the colonial period. Tafawa Balewa shares boundaries with plateau State in the South and Dass Local Government of Bauchi State in the North. The most prominent natural features in the area include the massive Mbula rock, and the Gongola River, which together with its numerous tributaries such as Lere, Maijuju, Jarawa and Bagel Rivers form the main drainage pattern of the place. Various ethnic groups inhabit the geographical area called Tafawa Balewa. These include, the sayawa, Hausa-Fulani, Jarawa and Sigidawa. Driberge ( 1 9 3 1 ) reports that Nine settlements emerged in the area in the_pre-calomal period where the people settled, the clan settlement pattern was supposed to have its own grinding place cal led \"Vim Tonga.\" Nigerian Academic Forum, Volume 10 No. 2, May, 2006. Political Organization of the People Balandier (1970), has provided a three-fold typology which will enable us to come to grasps with the political structures of the various people in the area. The first is the 'Chief Priest' system in which the political sphere is part and parcel of the social and religious structure. Second, is the Territorially Defined-Chieftainship, in which the members of the Community live in compact villages and give their allegiance direct ly to the chief in whom territorial, secular and religious authorities are combined. Here Communal ties override lineage ones as principles of political allegiance and organization.Third, the existence of bureaucratic machinery for the implementation of decisions on behalf of the society. In the area of study, the type of political structure that emerged was the Territorially Defined-Chieftainship, while in the chief-priest system members of the Community lived in scattered villages and relate to the total Community in terms of their individual lineages. Before the 19\" Century, the people lived in compact villages and gave their allegiance directly to the chief in whom territorial, secular, and religious authority were combined. The chiefs were responsible for the administration of justice and the settlement of disputes between lineages. Most of the settlements of the Sayawa had these features. (Dauda, 1999). In this case they were never at any period brought under any centralized administration. On the other plain was the type of political organization called a \"State.\" This refers to the area in which centralized political system existed before the establishment of the emirate system of government. In this area, the machinery of governance was noticeable. In such areas political leaders exercised their powers and authority, not on the basis of ethnic or genealogical connections, although this may be relevant, but on the basis of coercive powers which enable them to maintain their positions. The state that emerged in this area was Lere, founded by the Hausa immigrants who traced thei r origin to Zazzau (Zaria). 'They were also referred to as Zage-Zagi (Dauda, 1999). Lere had a chief called Sarki and a number of officials (all of them hereditary) under him. These chiefs included; Ciroma, Madaki, Sarkin Noma, and Galadima. Thus a centralized State had emerged in Lere but it could not use its military superiority to subdue the whole of Tafawa Balewa and bring it under its tutelage (Garba, 1984; Howard, 1908). Economic and Social Relations The most important economic activity of the people of the area was farming. In the culture of the Jarawa, Sayawa, Gerawa and Sigidawa, there existed two types of farming, namely, the 'Kidn dihn' (Backyard) farm. This type of farming was done very close to the house. The second type of farming was the 'Kidn namtsih' (country farm). This was usually located very far from the homes. The proximity of the Kidn dihn to the home made it very suitable for women to cultivate. Maize, Okro and vegetables were found in the Kidn dihn (Aliyu, 1974). Men cultivated the more distant country farms. The Hausa Fulani were cattle rearers who were involved in seasonal transhumancc. Apart from those Fulani who lived in 'Ruga' (make-shift residence) and provided 'nono' (milk) for the other groups in the area, the main economic activity of the Fulani was cattle rearing. There was therefore a symbiotic relationship between them and the farming community, as they required the cow dung for manure, while the other provided foodstuff. It was exactly this kind of understanding that existed between the various groups that was referred to as very cordial. It is agreed that the Jarawa and Sayawa regarded themselves as playmates. Sayawa/Hausa-Fulani relation was equally cordial. The nomadic Fulani mainly concerned themselves with acquiring some form of guarantee for their right to graze their cattle, which was never denied (Dauda, 1999). Ethnic Formations and Inter-Group Relations The problem associated with the pattern of ethnic relations in Tafawa Balewa revolves around the question of the ownership of the place. This places a big border on the question of the foundation of the place, the origin of the name 'Tafawa Balewa'; and citizenship. The Origin of Tafawa Balewa A lot of controversy surrounds the history of the area of study, Tafawa Balewa. The Bauchi Emirate Council and the Sayawa people agree that the name Tafawa Balewa came from a dome of granite about 200 meters high, situated by the riverside on entering the town. However, both of them disagree that each inhabited the area before the other. Tafawa Balcwa is a Fulani word meaning 'black stone'. The Fulani used the name to describe the huge black rock found in the town. (Bauchi Emirate Council, 1991). According to the council, in a submission to the Bauchi State Committee on the Creation of Sayawa chiefdom in 1991. The leadership of Tafawa Balewa town should have been rested in the Fulani, its founders. However, because every dry season, they have to travel southwards with their catt le in search of pasture and water it became difficult for them to give meaningful leadership especially for their sedentary neighbours. The leadership went to their next earlier settlers, the Kanun. Tafawa Balewa witnessed six Kanuri warheads, often, succession to thrones break when there is no suitable candidates from the ruling family. It was this circumstance that the Kanuri \"dynasty\" in Tafawa Balewa was interfaced with that of Angasawa \"Dynasty\" bul NEVER the Sayawa who were in fact not in Tafawa Balewa until the 1970s. The Sayawa have equally laid claim to Tafawa Balewa as the earliest inhabitants, tracing their migration to the area to the 13 lh century from the south of Tchad, and the Kanem Bornu Empire. They claim to have settled first at the foot of the black stone, which was then called Puji. They refer to the", "year": 2015, "openAccessPdf": null, "authors": []}

In rats, however, Woodruff and Simpson (1954,1955) found that complete, or almost complete, tolerance developed regularly in animals injected on the day of birth and occasionally in animals injected at the age of 2 weeks. It was shown further that administration of cortisone for 12 days, starting on the day of injection of the homologous cells, did not decisively alter the probability that tolerance would be induced, but that when tolerance did occur it tended to be a little more complete in cortisone-treated animals. Of considerable interest was the discovery that, when tolerance was not quite complete, a second graft from the original donor sometimes broke down, while the first graft showed no change. This would seem to add further support to the writer\u2019s hypothesis of the critical period (Woodruff, 1952, 1954). These results have been published elsewhere (Wood& and Simpson, 1955). For purposes of comparison, however, they have been summarized in TABLES 1 and 2t. The new material presented here concerns an attempt to retard the development of immunological maturity with respect to the reaction to homologous tissue antigens. It was decided to try administration of cortisone and somatotrophin, because these hormones are known to influence the development of young rats and because their effects are in some respects antagonistic (Parmer, Katonah, and Angrist, 1951). So far, however, only cortisone has been tried. The general plan was very similar to that employed in the earlier experiments. Six litters of newborn Wistar rats were taken from stock, and the number in each litter was reduced to 8. Each immature rat received a daily injection of 0.05 mg. cortisone, starting on the day of birth and continuing for 14, 21, or 28 days.

Thus, he concluded that self-tolerance is acquired during fetal development by the intermingling of sibling cells via the placental circulation. Further, he concluded immune tolerance to self is not genetically determined or innate!! They have exploited this process to engraft human stem cells in a large animal (sheep) via in utero transplantation (IUT). Advantages to large animal investigation include long life span and large size to permit serial sampling. Using parallel serial studies in developing sheep fetuses stem cell engraftment receptivity and sheep lymphoid ontogeny were assayed longitutinally. Then they were able to identify an engraftment window and propose our antigen exposure model to explain acquisition of immune tolerance to self as chimeric animals display life-long immune tolerance to the graft. The subsequent chimeras yield human hematopoietic, islet, hepatic, cardiac and gastrointestinal cellular elements in situ. Circulating human proteins (IgM, Albumin, Factor VIII, C-peptide and \uf061-fetoprotein) are detected years after transplantation. Therefore, they believe a fully tolerant large animal host provides an ideal in vivo method to test human stem cell differentiation capacity. This presentation will discuss evidence for immune tolerance, the pivotal role of the thymus and potential advantages/controversies in assaying stem cell differentiation in vivo (in comparison to immune deficient animal models) following IUT.

The objectives of the present study were to determine whether a relationship exists between the duration of ovulatory follicle development and pregnancy rates following artificial insemination (AI) in dairy cows undergoing spontaneous oestrous cycles, and to identify factors influencing follicle turnover and pregnancy rate and the relationship between these two variables. Follicle development was monitored by daily transrectal ultrasonography from 10 days after oestrus until the subsequent oestrus in 158 lactating dairy cows. The cows were artificially inseminated following the second observed oestrus and pregnancy was diagnosed 35 days later. The predominant pattern of follicle development was two follicle waves (74.7%) with three follicle waves in 22.1% of oestrous cycles and four or more follicle waves in 3.2% of oestrous cycles. The interval from ovulatory follicle emergence to oestrus (EOI) was 3 days longer (P < 0.0001) in cows with two follicle waves than in those with three waves. Ovulatory follicles from two-wave oestrous cycles grew more slowly but were approximately 2 mm larger (P < 0.0001) on the day of oestrus. Twin ovulations were observed in 14.2% of oestrous cycles and occurred more frequently (P < 0.001) in three-wave oestrous cycles; consequently EOI was shorter in cows with twin ovulations. Overall, 57.0% of the cows were diagnosed pregnant 35 days after AI. Linear logistic regression analysis revealed an inverse relationship between EOI and the proportion of cows diagnosed pregnant, among all cows (n = 158; P < 0.01) and amongst those with single ovulations (n = 145; P < 0.05). Mean EOI was approximately 1 day shorter (P < 0.01) in cows that became pregnant than in non-pregnant cows; however, pregnancy rates did not differ significantly among cows with different patterns of follicle development. These findings confirm and extend previous observations in pharmacologically manipulated cattle and show, for the first time, that in dairy cows undergoing spontaneous oestrous cycles, natural variation in the duration of post-emergence ovulatory follicle development has a significant effect on pregnancy rate, presumably reflecting variation in oocyte developmental competence.", "year": 2004, "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://rep.bioscientifica.com/downloadpdf/journals/rep/127/5/1270621.pdf", "status": "BRONZE"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "48227625", "name": "E.

To his friends (and that included almost everyone), Ray was a complex man with a simple affect. He was an uncommon mixture of a highly critical and careful scientist overlaid on the soul of a mensch. We recall Ray's many and important scientific accomplishments below, but will finish with a particular trait of the Owen lab: twice daily coffee.Ray David Owen was born in rural Genesee, Wisconsin (population 180) on October 30, 1915. His father was a dairy farmer, and Ray grew up with a farmer's habit of early rising and hard work. He helped work the family farm through three years at nearby Carroll College (Waukesha, Wisconsin), where he majored in biology; the biology department there consisted of a single faculty member. Ray had planned to become a teacher and even went so far as to practice teaching in his hometown. Perhaps most importantly, he met his future wife-June Weissenberg-at Carroll College. He was married to June in 1938, a marriage that lasted for 74 years, until her death.Ray began graduate work at the University of Wisconsin, and his earliest work that we could locate was on the iris color in pigeons (Hollander and Owen 1939a, 1939b). This study using chemical approaches to understand genetics proved to be an important harbinger of his later studies-an approach that he never gave up on. His early fondness for pigeons and doves continued in his own PhD work on the expression of hybrid antigens on crosses between guinea fowl and domestic fowl. This work represents first use of specially produced antibodies that detected neo-antigens on the hybrids that were not present on either parent, and this result foreshadows much of the work of the late twentieth century on the detection of neo-antigens in cancer. He also brought the pigeon models to his graduate students later in his career.Ray's most important single contribution is the famous twin cattle observation. It is important to note that this was not an experiment per se but an observation: an experiment of nature that only a thoughtful observer could interpret. Ray noticed that each of the twin offspring of a cow inseminated by two different bulls expressed blood groups consistent with both sires (Owen 1945). This observation could not be accounted for by then-current Mendelian genetic understanding. Ray, with his previous knowledge of cattle development, surmised that two things had happened: first, that there was a colonization of the blood system of each calf with its co-twin's hematopoietic stem cells; and second, that these acquired cells are capable of becoming established to provide a source of blood cells throughout life, despite their difference from the \"host\" blood cells. In Ray's oral history, he describes his development in 1946 of the idea of acquired unresponsiveness for a seminar at Caltech. These studies led to the idea of acquired immunological tolerance, which was profound. The paper was recognized but not widely cited until the observations of Anderson et al. (1951) and Billingham, Brent, and Medawar (1953). It is clear that the Medawar group appreciated the importance of the cattle observation. This is stated explicitly in Brent's obituary of Owen published in The Independent, as well as in a letter from Medawar to Owen after the awarding of the Nobel Prize to Medawar and Burnet.In 1946, with the blessing of his department chair, Ray took a leave from the University of Wisconsin and came to Caltech on a short-term appointment as a Gosney Fellow. The appointment transformed into a permanent faculty position a couple of years later, and Ray never returned to Madison.Although the discovery of acquired tolerance is of vast importance, Owen made many other contributions. During a sabbatical at Oak Ridge National Laboratory to work with Dan Lindsley (a Caltech PhD who became a noted Drosophila geneticist), he performed seminal experiments on bone marrow transplantation. \u2026", "year": 2017, "openAccessPdf": null, "authors": [{"authorId": "1950617", "name": "J.

The SET was equipped with a long-lasting battery via solar panel and used a \u00abtwin pin\u00bb fixing system. Right ears of 12 newborns and 26 adolescent animals were tagged with the SET. While left ears were tagged simultaneously with official ear tags in newborns, the adolescent animals already carried the official ear tags. The newborns stayed in a free stall barn during the entire experiment, while adolescent animals were housed in a free stall barn and on pasture during summer. All animals developed crusts beginning on day 7 after tagging with the SET. Pain reactions were observed occasionally in the first two weeks. Ear growth in newborns during 11 months of observation did not differ between ears with SET and official ear tags. Cortisol concentration in saliva of newborns decreased in the first week after tagging which is physiological for this age group. In older animals cortisol concentrations in saliva were not affected. We registered 19 incidences in 11 animals with the SET, that required veterinary or staff intervention. Two animals lost the SET with ear injury. Scars due to tag migration were observed in ears of all newborns after the 9th month of observation. In conclusion, SET with a weight of 32\u2009g that need a twin pin fixation in cows do not seem to induce systemic or local inflammations more frequently compared to official ear tags; however, the higher risk of accidental injuries and migration in ear cartilage would not meet Swiss welfare standards and the attachment to the ear needs to be improved for general use.", "year": 2023, "openAccessPdf": null, "authors": [{"authorId": "2226882872", "name": "Gobbo Oliveira Er\u00fcnl\u00fc"}, {"authorId": "2069936685", "name": "S.

The production benefit achieved by having continuous free-access to both species is due to higher intakes of clover, higher feed conversion efficiency, and possibly reduced energy expenditure as less time is spent searching for the preferred diet. AIMS Pastures for sheep production are typically sown with mixtures of grasses and legumes. These species are complementary to each other in many ways. The legume fixes nitrogen from the atmosphere and supplies nitrogen to the grass. They are also complementary in nutritional attributes. Clover has a high concentration of protein, which is rapidly degraded in the rumen. Grass by comparison has a higher concentration of fibre. A combination of the two species should match the nutritional requirements of the sheep or cattle more closely than either species alone. In practice, grass-clover mixtures do not consistently perform to their theoretical potential because the clover content of mixed pastures is often less than 10 to 20% (Quigley et al. 1992). Maintaining a high proportion of clover is especially difficult in rotational grazing systems, and the proportion of clover varies seasonally and from year to year. When offered a free choice of grass and clover ad libitum both sheep and cattle consistently choose a diet containing around 70% clover and 30% grass. The high proportion of clover that they like to eat is in marked contrast to the proportion offered to them in mixed pastures. Growing grass and clover side by side in the same paddock may be an effective way to grow more clover and allow animals to select their preferred diet. METHOD The concept of splitting grass and clover was tested during 2002 and 2003 near Hamilton in southwest Victoria. There were four pasture treatments; (i) pure perennial ryegrass; (ii) pure subterranean clover; (iii) mixture of ryegrass and subterranean clover (85:15 mix); and (iv) side-by-side blocks of ryegrass and subterranean clover (50:50 by area). Feed on offer was maintained at greater than 2000 kg DM/ha at all times. Three replicates of each pasture system were grazed by 120 Coopworth/Corriedale ewes with two-month-old twin lambs over 7 weeks from mid-October 2002. The experiment was repeated in 2003 with 4 replicates grazed by 180 twin-bearing ewes from 2 weeks prior to lambing in August until weaning at 12 weeks of age. Pasture quantity and quality was measured 2 weekly, sheep were weighed every 1-2 weeks and feed intake was measured using the alkane technique on 3-4 occasions each year.", "year": 2020, "openAccessPdf": null, "authors": [{"authorId": "2062208135", "name": "R.

Miniature cattle are approximately one fourth the size of standard cattle and, therefore, represent a potentially less expensive, safer, and more easily managed animal model. Our limited attempts to reproduce miniature cattle via in vivo and in vitro production of embryos resulted in poor response to superovulation and logistical challenges in recovering embryos or oocytes due to the small size of the animals. Thus, the purpose of this study was to evaluate the potential of embryos derived by chromatin transfer from fibroblasts of a miniature cow and cytoplasts from cows of standard size to produce viable offspring after transfer into recipient cows of standard size. The donor of somatic cells was a heifer that weighed 7.7 kg at birth. Chromatin transfer resulted in 19% (82/428) blastocyst formation. A total of 66 cloned blastocysts (65 excellent/good quality, 1 fair quality) were transferred into 26 synchronized recipients.

With .1 \u00a3 10 IVF babies already born in the world, the efficacy of these techniques is beyond question. However, we must now fight for the safety of these procedures, since safety and efficacy are closely connected aspects. Figures from the Spanish National Institute of Statistics for the period 1982\u20132002 show that the rate of twin births has doubled, while there has been a 7-fold increase in triplets. From the obstetric point of view we know that multiple pregnancies are associated with a considerable increase in the risks for these patients. As for fetal risks, it is accepted that each additional fetus means a 3 week reduction in the duration of the pregnancy, with the result that levels of prematurity and cerebral palsy increase exponentially in a clear association with the number of fetuses. Nor can we overlook the significant increase in health care costs that arise in multiple pregnancies (Bertarelli-Spath, 2003; Bhattacharya and Templeton, 2004; Gerris et al., 2004). Although the majority of high-order multiple pregnancies come from ovulation induction or enhancement treatment (Tur et al., 2005), the large majority of twin or triple pregnancies have their origin in IVF (Jain et al., 2004; Nyboe Andersen et al., 2004). This is the very technique in which prevention can be practised clearly and directly by limiting the number of embryos to be transferred, thus optimizing efficiency without increasing risks. Talk of crude pregnancy rates is now obsolete and we must incorporate new parameters such as the BESST score (birth emphasizing a successful singleton at term), which shows the percentage of live term birth of singleton baby per assisted reproduction treatment cycle begun (Min et al., 2004). However, the good results of modern obstetrics mean that twin pregnancies are medically acceptable and so, as with single pregnancies, they can be considered as successes for assisted reproduction treatment (Dickey et al., 2004). In recent years and thanks to the pioneering work of the Scandinavian teams (Vilska et al., 1999) policies of limiting the number of embryos to transfer have proliferated. In young patients it is possible to perform selectively one elective single embryo transfer (ESET) or double embryo transfer (DET) without the pregnancy rates being noticeably affected (Heijnen et al., 2004). Nevertheless, it is obvious that for widespread application of these strategies an IVF team has to have an outstanding performance accompanied by an excellent embryofreezing programme, and must not suffer legal restrictions to embryo freezing as currently happens in some European countries. If these conditions exist, I feel that this is the time for evaluation of the quality of a programme not only in terms of implantation rates but of the percentage of cycles in which ESET is applied (Land and Evers, 2004; Ombelet et al., 2005). With a view to having objective criteria as to the advisability of transferring one, two or three embryos, we have designed a multiple pregnancy score (MPS) based on the retrospective analysis of our own material. After the application of the appropriate statistical methodology by means of receiver operating curves (ROC) we were able to identify that the parameters most closely connected with the establishment of a multiple pregnancy were the age of the patient (#34 years) and the total number of high quality embryos that were available for replacement ($2); high MPS values make it advisable to transfer fewer embryos (Table I) (Barri et al., 2004). The utility of this lies in the fact that it makes it possible to base the decision as to the number of embryos to be transferred on objective criteria, thus avoiding subjective bias on the part of the doctor or of the patient. I am convinced that if a programme has implantation rates of .25% and pregnancy rates by cryoreplacement .35% then there is an obligation to apply restrictive policies on the number of embryos to transfer. In our programme we have never transferred more than three embryos in the last 3 years. We have ESET rates of 30%, and 45% for DET, and three embryos are transferred in 25% of the IVF cycles. According to the experience acquired when applying the MPS based on these criteria of patient\u2019s age and total number of top quality embryos, we have been able to design a more restrictive policy of embryo replacement.

However, in vitro-produced embryos result in lower pregnancy and higher abortion rates and in some cases increased rates of abnormality and mortality in calves. The present study was conducted to investigate the effects of various factors such as recipient parity, delivery season, offspring number, pregnancy period, delivery type, midwifery type, dystocia and vaccination, on the viability of calves derived from embryos produced in vitro. Korean Native Cow ovaries were obtained from local slaughterhouse and cumulus-oocyte complexes (COCs) were aspirated from 2 to 8 mm follicles. Selected COCs were matured in TCM-199 supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FBS), 1 \u00bcML FSH, 10 \u00bcML LH and 1 \u00bcML Estradiol-17\u00b2 for 20-22 h. In vitro-matured oocytes were fertilized using frozen-thawed percoll separated semen (Day 0) in fer-TALP medium for 20 h. The presumptive zygotes were cultured in CR1aa medium supplemented with 0.3% BSA (before Day 3) or 10%FBS (After Day 3). All types of cultures were made in an incubator at 38.5\u00b0, 5% CO2 in air. Statistical analysis was performed using the Chi-square test. Two blastocysts were transferred to the Holstein recipients (n = 1888). The parturition was occurred in total 755 recipients. There was no difference in the abnormality of calves among treatments. The incidence of disease was significantly higher in single calf than twin calves (18.4 vs. 6.7%), in multiparous than nulliparous group (40.0 vs. 9.9%), in eutocia than dystocia group (20.0 vs. 4.8%), in spring and winter groups than summer and autumn groups (20.3, 22.7 vs. 4.3, 0.0%), and in non-vaccinated than vaccinated group (22.7 vs. 1.6%), respectively (p < 0.05). The rate of mortality was significantly higher when transferred into nulliparous than multiparous (22.3 vs. 0.0%), when were dystocia than eutocia group (71.4 vs. 14.1%), when were non-midwifery than midwifery (45.0 vs. 13.6), when delayed midwifery than earlier midwifery (31.6 vs. 11.5%), and when were non-vaccinated than vaccinated group (28.0 vs. 9.8%), respectively (P < 0.05).

Incorrect reprogramming of epigenetic markings such as DNA methylation is associated with compromised prenatal development and postnatal abnormalities. Clones that survive into adulthood, in contrast, are assumed to possess a normalized epigenome corresponding to their normal phenotype. To address this point, we used capillary electrophoresis to measure 5-methylcytosine (5mC) levels in leukocyte DNA of 38 healthy female bovine clones that represented five genotypes from the Simmental breed and four genotypes from the Holstein breed. The estimated variance in 5mC level within clone genotypes of both breeds [0.104, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.070-0.168] was higher than between clone genotypes (0, CI: 0-0.047). We quantified the contribution of SCNT to this unexpected variability by comparing the 19 Simmental clones with 12 female Simmental monozygotic twin pairs of similar age. In Simmental clones, the estimated variability within genotype (0.0636, CI: 0.0358-0.127) was clearly higher than in twin pairs (0.0091, CI: 0.0047-0.0229). In clones, variability within genotype (0.0636) was again higher than between genotypes (0, CI: 0-0.077). Twins, in contrast, showed lower variability within genotypes (0.0091) than between genotypes (0.0136, CI: 0.00250-0.0428). Importantly, the absolute deviations of 5mC values of individual SCNT clones from their genotype means were fivefold increased in comparison to twins. Further comparisons with noncloned controls revealed DNA hypermethylation in most of the clones. The clone-specific variability in DNA methylation and DNA hypermethylation clearly show that healthy adult SCNT clones must be considered as epigenome variants.", "year": 2010, "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://europepmc.org/articles/pmc2993042?pdf=render", "status": "GREEN"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "48885626", "name": "B. de Montera"}, {"authorId": "114415155", "name": "Dalia El Zeihery"}, {"authorId": "50544131", "name": "S.

The old adage of the title has a parallel in the scientific world\u2014\u201call research leads to biomedical advances.\u201d The fact that research in one discipline contributes to another is well understood by the scientific community. It is not, however, so clear to the public or to public policy-makers. Because public support for funding of biomedical research is strong, the scientific community could build a more effective case for public support of all science by articulating how research in other disciplines benefits biomedicine. The time is ripe to improve public appreciation of science. A recent National Science Foundation survey suggested that Americans continue to support research expenditures. In addition, public opinion polls indicate that scientists and science leaders enjoy enviably high public esteem, second only to that accorded to physicians. Instead of lamenting the lack of public understanding of science, we can work to enhance public appreciation of scientific research by showing how investigations in many areas intertwine and contribute to biomedical advances. A crucial task is to convey to the public, in easily understood terms, the specific benefits and the overall good that result from research in all areas of science. For instance, the public may not fully understand the physical principles behind lasers, but it clearly can appreciate the extraordinary medical benefits resulting from this technology. Take, for example, agricultural research. On the surface, it may appear to have made few significant contributions to biomedical advances, except those directly related to human nutrition. This view is incorrect, however. In the case of nutrition, the connections between agricultural and biomedical research are best exemplified by the vitamin discoveries. At the turn of the century, when the concept of vitamins had not yet surfaced and nutrition as a scientific discipline did not exist, it was in a department of agricultural chemistry that the first true demonstration of vitamins was made. Single-grain feeding experiments documented the roles of vitamins A and B and of nicotinic acid (niacin). The essential role of some minerals (iron, copper, and iodine) was shown later, and these discoveries provided the basis of modern human nutrition research. Despite such direct links, however, it is the wondrously serendipitous discoveries that have been made in agricultural research that reveal its true importance to biomedicine. Life-saving antibiotics such as streptomycin were discovered in soil microorganisms. The first embryo transplant was made in a dairy cow, and related research led to advances in the understanding of human reproduction. Coumarin, extracted from moldy clover hay that caused cattle \u201cbleed\u201d disease, was the active ingredient in the first blood anticoagulant medicine used to treat heart problems (President Eisenhower's heart condition was treated with dicoumarol). In minute quantities, botulinum, a deadly food toxin, reduces muscle contraction and is effective in the treatment of dystonias, stuttering, and Parkinson's disease. The discovery of immunological tolerance in fraternal calf twins provided the basis for understanding and treatment of rejection in organ transplantation. And edible vaccines are being produced in seeds and plant parts that will, in the not-too-distant future, provide a source of inexpensive, highly transportable vaccines with long shelf lives. Cowling et al.* recently made a comparative analysis of agricultural and medical research in an attempt to document the aggregate return to society from each domain. Although these two areas of research substantially affect the quality of our lives, their linkages are not readily apparent. The contributions of specific scientific research to biomedical advances should certainly be emphasized, but a compelling case must also be made that all sciences, math, and engineering are inextricably interrelated and contribute to better health for us all. We need to work to convince the public that without advances in nonmedical fields, crucial advances in biomedicine will be severely hampered. After all, it is the totality of the science and technology enterprise that will provide the basis for a secure future, in medicine and in other areas of life.", "year": 1996, "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://www.science.org/doi/pdf/10.1126/science.274.5288.701?download=true", "status": "CLOSED"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "10800871", "name": "J.

products and ensure food security, increase requirements to quality decisions taken at all levels of management in the sectors of agriculture. Analysis of economic indicators in agricultural organizations in Leningrad Region, which is the leader of dairy cattle in Russia, showed that in the regions of Northern NonBlack Earth Region with a low agroclimatic potential, traditionally attributed to risk farming zone, integrated development of innovative technologies in production and management, including digital and biotechnology, is able to provide a high level of milk production efficiency. Development of technology leads to a dynamic increase in the amount of information created about animals and parameters of the production process. Special devices and equipment (motion sensors, fatness scanners, electronic scales for weighing animals during their movements, computerized automatic devices for individual analysis of milk biochemical composition with sampling using special algorithms, etc.) form large arrays of data, that allows us to say about the beginning of industry BIG DATE formation. Telecommunications systems in farms, special algorithms for collecting and analyzing large data arrays make it possible to create and use digital twin models for both individual animals and their groups, and dairy farming in farms as a whole, combining information from all stages of production and business processes in automatic or semiautomatic mode. The decisive influence of feeding system on milk productivity and animal health, their reproductive functions and productive longevity, on the efficiency of milk production, increases the relevance of developing a system for managing ruminal digestion of highly productive cows based on current research in digital and biotechnologies, able to provide a synergistic effect of introducing into production results of research in the field of genetics, both cows and microorganisms inhabiting their rumen.", "year": 2019, "openAccessPdf": null, "authors": [{"authorId": "2070587415", "name": "V.

However, pockets of intensive cultivation do exist, particularly in those sections of the better-watered eastern coast where streams have built up stretches of fertile alluvial soil. Such valley plains are rarely more than a few square miles in extent, but they help significantly to sustain the large urban populations of the coastal regions. One of the most important alluvial lowlands is found in the Hunter River Valley (Fig. 1), a basin of nearly 9000 square miles with the city of Newcastle at the river mouth. The valley is noted for its production of coal and steel, but also has a complex rural economy based on dairying, crop farming, beef cattle raising, sheep grazing, and timber production. Generally, the Hunter River flows through undulating terrain composed of Permian conglomnerates, sandstones, and shales; but in favored areas round Scone, Muswellbrook, Singleton, and Maitland significant plain pockets occur. It is with the crop-dairy combination of part of the Maitland Flats that the present survey is concerned. Concentrated in a small area of flood plain in the lower part of the valley is a group of farms which provides an interesting study of the interplay of physical and economic forces in the evolution of a land use pattern. Unlike the dairy farms, which generally range in size from 80 to 200 acres, the crop properties are small by Australian standards, commonly between 20 and 40 acres, but not unlike those found in other high-producing areas scattered throughout the continent. The particular interest of these farms lies in a number of features: the twin dangers of flood and moisture stress; short-term stability combined with longterm changes in crop combinations; the influence of a stringent milk zoning system on1 dairying techniques; and, Onl the purely cash-crop farms, the distinctive arrangement of fenceless fields. The core of the area described here occupies only about 6700 acres (Fig. 2), mainly less than 25 feet above sea level. It is located a few miles upstream from the river mouth near the city of Maitland, from which the term \"Maitland Flats\" derives its name. The core area comprises the Bolwarra and Phoenix Park sectors of the Flats, lying between the bend in the Hunter River at Lorn and the lower reaches of the Paterson River, which joins the Hunter below the town and erstwhile port of", "year": 1962, "openAccessPdf": null, "authors": [{"authorId": "78932402", "name": "K.

It is well established that the probability of success in establishment of a tissue transplant is a function of the coefficient of relationship between the donor and the recipient. In normal situations the probability of a successful transplant is effectively zero in the absence of genetic and therefore antigenic identity between host and donor. It has been found that under certain circumstances the strict genetic requirements for successful homotransplantation can be circumvented. The observations of Owen (1945) on the blood types of dizygotic twins in cattle and a similar observation in man (Dunsford et al., 1953) have demonstrated that the fetus will accept a natural homograft of erythropoietic tissue from its twin, whose tissues it would certainly reject as an adult. Artificial homotransplantation of erythropoietic tissue into fetal rats has been demonstrated by Ripley and Owen (see Horowitz and Owen, 1954). Thus the use of a fetal host circumvents, a t least in some cases, the immunogenetic restrictions to homotransplantation. I t has been further demonstrated that establishment of a homograft in a fetal host renders the host tolerant of skin grafts from the same donor in later life. This was first shown for fraternal twins in cattle (Anderson et al., 1951; and Billingham el al., 1952). It was also demonstrated in both chickens and mice (Billingham et al., 1953, 1955) that injection (and probably implantation) of adult cells into an enibryonic host renders the host subsequently tolerant of homografts from the same donor. The mentioned procedures, which require access to the host during fetal life, raised the question of whether the importance of the genetic relation between host and homograft donor could be decreased by treatment of an adult host. Main and Prehn (1955) found that the skin of mice of 1 strain could be successfully grafted onto adult hosts of another strain if the latter had been irradiated heavily and injected, immediately postirradiation, with bone marrow from a hybrid of the 2 strains. Similarly, it has been demonstrated that homologous rat bone marrow can be successfully transplanted as a functional erythropoietic tissue following total-body X irradiation of the recipients (Lindsley et al., 1955), whereas nonirradiated hosts fail to accept such a transplant.", "year": 1957, "openAccessPdf": null, "authors": [{"authorId": "2253220268", "name": "T.

Peripheral NK activity was recorded lower in women who became pregnant. In Sant Parmanand Hospital, Delhi, infertility in 46 women, mean duration 64 months S.E. 6.2 months, was dealt with by lowering the peripheral CD19 and CD56 counts. All had prolonged unexplained infertility with a positive post-coital test, patent fallopian tubes, confirmed ovulation and a spouse with normal seminal fluid. The decline resulted in 84.8% success including live births, 39 women, twin live births, three women, abortion, four cases, abortion, and twin abortion in one case. Peripheral NK cells were quantified at the Double Helix Cytogenetics and Reproductive Immunology Centre located 6 km away. Two-colored immunofluorescence analyses were performed on peripheral blood employing FITC-labeled antibodies to CD19 and CD56 on a Profile II Cytometer (Coulter Diagnostics, Miami Lakes, FL, USA). The CD19 counts in 41 women averaged 14.78, S.E. 0.57, while CD56 counts in 31 had averaged 17.7 with S.E. 0.74. Both cell counts had been higher than the respective normal ranges of 3\u20138% and 3\u201312% (downloaded on October 23, 2005 from http://reprod-med.net/tests/ phenoinfo.php). After obtaining consent from the patient and spouse and ethical clearance from the relevant authorities, spouse was examined for serologic profiles for hepatitis B and C virus, HIV and syphilis. Husband mononuclear cells from 20 ml of peripheral blood were separated by density gradient employing Sigma-Aldrich Histopaque 1119 and Histopaque 1077. Mononuclear cells with 90\u201395% purity and 98\u2013100% viability were transported by road and given irrespective of the menstrual cycle phase, in 2-ml volumes by subcutaneous route. All had varying degrees of pain, swelling, redness at the injection site. There were no reports of any delayed adverse reaction among the vaccinees. Immunizations were continued till there was a drop in cell counts to the otherwise normal threshold level. After an average of six immunizations, CD19 and CD56 cell count values were trimmed down. The pre-vaccinations mean values of CD19 cells were 14.7%, S.E. 0.57. The respective post-vaccination values were 7.4%, S.E. 0.19% (P < 0.0001). Similar CD56 mean values were 17.7%, S.E. 0.74, and 10.5%, S.E. 0.27% (P < 0.0001). Following immunization by husband mononuclear cells, 20 conceived normally, whereas an intrauterine insemination was carried out in eight cases, and in-vitro fertilization in 17. Furthermore, in four patients, their tumor necrosis factor-a (TNF) had been lowered during immunizations. The role of elevated peripheral NK activity in recurrent spontaneous abortion, as documented at Tokai University School of Medicine, has been manifest in the private sector tertiary care hospital in the Indian capital metropolis. Rather than a solitary immunization with mononuclear cells in a controlled trail in the USA during the last decade, an average of six immunizations was offered by us. The response was monitored by frequent enumeration of CD19 and CD56 cells. The endpoint was a cell count in the normal range. Fiscal restraints obstructed monitoring the cell count after every immunization. Selection of husband rather than the patient herself for mononuclear cells was based on the British successful pregnancy outcome during the 1980s in 17 of 22 women given paternal cells compared with 10 of 27 given their own (Fisher\u2019s P 1\u20444 0.0088). Dearth of any data on NK cell values among local women with multiple pregnancies is unfortunate. Those figures rather than the conventional figures (downloaded on October 23, 2005 from http://reprod-med.net/tests/phenoinfo.php) would have served as the ideal and legitimate controls. There has been little information in southern Asia regarding the normal range of different lymphocyte subpopulations. Among 232 healthy blood donors in Singapore, NK cell counts were lower in females than in males, with significant difference for CD19 tally between Indians and other racial groups.

Background concentrations of PCHs were totally ignored. It is universally understood that all pollutants will exist at some level in soils or ambient air. When the authors assert the presence of \"toxic chemicals\" in the environments of local farms, they fail to grasp that whereas PCHs do exist in the Bonnybridge area, the published concentrations of these compounds are indistinguishable from normal background concentrations in United Kingdom soils. Furthermore, while PCH concentrations around Bonnybridge are considered normal, they have not changed since the Rechem chemical waste incinerator was closed in 1984. This would indicate that if the prevailing concentrations were the result of a local industrial activity that activity had nothing whatsoever to do with Rechem. Examination of the data presented on twinning rates in people (table 1) clearly shows a random occurrence of marginally raised rates. Of the 14 areas studied, five showed twinning levels above ten per 1000 in the period 1980-3. Only two of these five areas were also ten per 1000 during 1976-9; the other three areas which were raised in 1980-3 were low in 1976-9. Of the four raised areas in 1976-9, two were low during 1980-3. There is clearly no consistent trend over the two periods and it is difficult to establish whether human twinning is raised in the general area or not. The data presented for twinning in cattle would appear to establish a real effect, which also occurred at periods when the Rechem incinerator was not handling PCHs. The authors do not pursue the cause of this. Nor have they established the case for human twinning or made an attempt to determine the cause of cattle twinning, PCHs being indistinguishable from background. Clearly the presence of the Rechem incinerator is an irrelevance to this study, since there is no established effect which has been linked in any way to the presence of the plant.", "year": 1989, "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://oem.bmj.com/content/oemed/46/3/215.full.pdf", "status": "BRONZE"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2107312136", "name": "P.

But this seemingly timeless region has for the past 150 years been in a state of pervasive transformation. The region is no longer home exclusively to the traditional family farms of a few hundred acres. Vast drainage systems now crisscross the region, man-made adjuncts to the five rivers that flow through the area. Punctuating the rural vistas of enormous planted fields, each covering many square miles, are huge storage bins and silos, sprawling feedlots for beef cattle, and immense low-slung structures in which thousands of turkeys and hogs are raised with all the efficiency that contemporary agricultural science can muster. About 150 miles southwest of the Twin Cities, beyond Marshall, the roads begin a steady 30-mile ascent of nearly seven hundred feet to the crest of the Coteau des Prairies\u2014or Buffalo Ridge, as the locals call it. Coming over this rise, the visitor is met with a startling, even bizarre, sight. Stretching into the distance, as far as the eye can see, are enormous propellers perched atop hundred-foot towers, spinning relentlessly in the wind.

The term was first applied scientifically to plants made up of tissues from more than one genetically separate individual. In the animal kingdom chimeras are much rarer than among plants and are almost entirely confined to the lower phyla. They are perhaps best known among insects, in which, since the secondary sexual characters are determined by the genotype of each separate tissue and not by hormones, sex chimeras are not uncommon and each component shows normal characters. It is not difficult to create chimeras in the lower vertebrates, but, as one ascends the scale, immune reactions make this progressively harder. Among the mammals probably the first examples were found by F. R. Lillie,' who showed that in non-identical bovine twins the blood vascular systems frequently fused at the 10-20 mm. stage, thus making cross-transfusion possible: he also showed that the hormones of one twin may affect the other and that this effect is permanent, the adult female twin being sterile, owing presumably to the effects of her male twin's hormones in utero. This work was considerably extended in 1945 by R. D. Owen,2 who showed conclusively that in cattle the red blood cells of each twin could survive in the body of the other in adult life-that is, that the cells were not merely crossing from one twin into the other but were tissue homografts surviving and regenerating themselves in the host and that the host was tolerant to them. He cites a case of superfecundation where each calf had, in addition to its \" own \" cells, cells of a group that it could have inherited only from the sire of the other calf, and it proved possible to separate the two types of blood cell in vitro. In 1953 the phenomenon was described in man.3 In this case a group 0 individual who lacked a agglutinin in her serum not only had A cells in her circulation, but was regenerating these A cells and tolerant of them, and was not sterile. This observation is of fundamental immunological importance. In 1949 L. D. Felton4 defined the phenomenon of \"immunological paralysis \": he used it to describe the impairment of immunity caused by injecting adult mice with very large doses of type-specific pneumococcal polysaccharide.

According to the latest statistics of the International Embryo Transfer Society, in the year 2013 the half of the total embryos produced (also transferred) for transfer in the world were derived from OPU-IVF. The success of embryo production by OPU-IVF greatly depends on the efficacy of each technology involved, such as the number of healthy oocytes aspirated from the follicles during OPU and the culture conditions during in vitro maturation, IVF and subsequent embryo culture. After the transfer of produced embryos to the recipient cows, an early pregnancy diagnosis is important to save breeding costs for farmers by improving reproductive efficiency. For this purpose, the use of an ultrasonography is beneficial not only for the detection of early pregnancy but also for the determination of fetus sex and twin pregnancy.

In these experiments the circulations of the host embryo and the sex graft are related in a manner which is essentially similar to the relations existing between twin embryos in cattle. 1 In this analysis several important problems arise. It may be possible to determine first how early in development the sex potencies of the gonads and their laterality are fixed; secondly, whether these original sex potencies may be modified or inverted by transplanting the gonadal primordia during the morphologically indifferent stage to host embryos of opposite sexes; thirdly, the behavior of sexually differentiated right and left ovaries and testes when implanted to male and female host embryos. The method employed was essentially the same as previously reported. 2 The Wolffian body with its associated sex gland and adrenal was isolated with the aid of a binocular microscope from a donor embryo at various periods of incubation as indicated below. This isolated complex was then implanted to the chorioallantoic membrane of a host chick embryo. In this manner the right and left gonads were implanted to male and female host embryos. The transplantations were made in all cases upon host embryos during the ninth day of incubation, and permitted to grow for an average period of nine days. The grafts were then removed and prepared for histological examination. The sexual glands used in transplanting may be grouped into two stages of development or differentiation : (1) before sexual differentiation, that is, during the morphologically \u201cindifferent stage\u201d; and (2) after sexual differentiation.", "year": 1925, "openAccessPdf": null, "authors": [{"authorId": "11744379", "name": "B.

The present inability to provide large numbers of viable embryos from selected females still restricts genetic improvement, whilst variability in ovarian response to hormones limit the present capacity for increasing reproductive efficiency. Females are born with a large store of eggs which rapidly declines as puberty approaches. If these oocytes are normal then there is scope for increasing the reproductive potential of selected females. Oocytes must reach a certain size before they can complete all stages of development and the final changes that occur late in follicular development. It is likely that oocytes that do not produce specific factors at precise stages of development will not be viable. Hence, it is important to characterize oocyte secreted factors since there are potential indicators of oocyte quality. The mechanisms that determine ovulation rate have still not been fully elucidated. Indeed follicular atresia, the process whereby follicles regress, is still not known. A better understanding of these processes should prove pivotal for the synchronization of follicular growth, for more precise oestrous synchronization and improved superovulatory response. Nutrition can influence a whole range of reproductive parameters however, the pathways through which nutrition acts have not been fully elucidated. Metabolic hormones, particularly insulin and IGFs, appear to interact with gonadotrophins at the level of the gonads. Certainly gonadotropins provide the primary drive for the growth of follicles in the later stages of development and both insulin and IGF-1, possibly IGF-2, synergize with gonadotrophins to stimulate cell proliferation and hormone production. More research is required to determine the effects of other growth factors and their interaction with gonadotropins. There is evidence, particularly from studies with rodents, that steroids can also modulate follicular growth and development, although information is very limited for ruminants. There may be a role for oestrogens in synchronizing follicular waves, to aid in oestrous synchronization regimes and for removing the dominant follicle to achieve improved superovulatory responses. However more information is required to determine whether these are feasible approaches. Heritability for litter size is higher in sheep than in cattle. Exogenous gonadotropins are a commercially ineffective means of inducing twinning in sheep and cattle. Although there are differences in circulating gonadotropin concentrations, the mechanism(s) responsible for the high ovulation appear to reside essentially within the ovaries. The locus of the Booroola gene, a major gene for ovulation rate, has been established but not specifically identified. However sheep possessing major genes do provide extremely valuable models for investigating the mechanisms controlling ovulation rate, including a direct contrast to mono-ovulatory species such as cattle. In conclusion, the relationship between oocyte quality, in both healthy follicles and those follicles destined for atresia, must be resolved before the future potential for increasing embryo yield can be predicted. In addition, a greater understanding of the factors affecting folliculogenesis in ruminants should ensure that the full benefits ensuing from the precise control of ovarian function are achieved. The improved use of artificial insemination and embryo transfer that would ensue from a greater understanding of the processes of folliculo genesis, coupled with the new technologies of genome and linkage mapping, should ensure a more rapid rate of genetic gain.", "year": 1999, "openAccessPdf": null, "authors": [{"authorId": "1898901", "name": "R.

The objective of this study was to compare the performance of 1) twin calves raised by their dam (twin born-twin raised; TT); 2) twin calves where one calf was grafted to another cow that lost her calf and one calf was left with their dam (twin born-single raised; TS); and 3) single born calves that were raised by their dams (single born-single raised; S). To achieve twinning, sixty-three Angus-cross cows were estrus synchronized and artificially inseminated. Seven days later, an embryo was placed into the uterine horn contralateral to the corpus luteum. Fourteen twin pairs and 11 singleton calves were produced from the described technique. Three natural twin pairs were added to the study. Birth order was recorded for twin calves (1=first calf; 2=second calf). Birth weights (BW) and blood samples for measuring serum total protein, IgG1, and IgM were collected 24 h post-calving. Calves were weighed at approximately six months of age, and a 200-d adjusted weight was calculated using the following equation: [(ADG x 200 d) + BW=A200dW]. Calf behavior data collected included interval to standing and first nursing, duration of dam nursing, and duration of non-dam nursing. Single calves had greater (P < 0.001) BW compared to TT and TS. Adjusted 200-d weights were greater (P < 0.05) for S compared to TS. There was a positive correlation between BW and A200dW (r=.32; P < 0.05). Behavior data did not differ among raising methods.

In Exp. 1, Angus heifers (n = 50) received a 7-d Ovsynch + progesterone protocol (on d 0, GnRH and progesterone insert were administered; on d 7, progesterone insert was removed and PGF2\u03b1 was injected; and on d 9.5, GnRH was injected 56 h after progesterone removal) with eCG (0, 300, 500, 700, or 1,000 IU) administered on d 7.

In Exp. 3, Angus cows (n = 18) received a 6-d Ovsynch + progesterone protocol and were randomly assigned to receive 0 or 800 IU eCG on d 3 of the protocol (Exp. 3a). A pilot field trial was also performed using the same treatments in suckled Angus-cross cows (n = 72; Exp. 3b). In Exp. 4, beef heifers (n = 200) were assigned randomly to the same treatments as in Exp. 3, but the second GnRH was not given, with Holstein bulls introduced on d 6. In Exp. 5, Angus cows (n = 12) received the same treatment as in Exp. 3, but were not inseminated. Progesterone concentrations were assessed in plasma collected during the estrous cycle following synchronization. Ultrasonography was used to monitor ovarian dynamics and to diagnose pregnancy. In Exp. 1, the mean number of ovulations was affected (P < 0.02) by the dose of eCG and the stage of follicular development when administered. Treatment with eCG on d 2 tended (P < 0.08) to extend the interval from PGF2\u03b1 to ovulation, but was not successful in inducing double ovulations. In contrast, eCG on d 3 increased (P < 0.01) the number of cows with double ovulation when administered i.m. and increased (P < 0.04) pregnancy rate in single ovulating heifers after bull breeding (68.0 vs. 53.1%). This treatment also elevated progesterone concentrations during the estrous cycle following synchronization. Thus, the mechanism by which administration of eCG on d 3 of the synchronization increased pregnancy rates may be through supporting development of a healthy follicle and subsequent corpus luteum capable of secreting increased concentrations of progesterone during early pregnancy. In conclusion, strategic administration of eCG during a synchronization protocol can be used to improve reproductive performance through increased pregnancy rates in single ovulating animals as well as the induction of twin ovulations for twinning.", "year": 2014, "openAccessPdf": null, "authors": [{"authorId": "2219748191", "name": "M.

Here we evaluate a production scheme involving single and bilateral twin transfer of Holstein female embryos to beef cattle recipients. Holstein oocytes were fertilized with the X-bearing fraction of gender-sorted Holstein semen. Cumulus cells were removed with aid of a vortex or microfluidic device (\u03bcFD). Half of the vortexed embryos were cultured in KSOMaaBSA (control), as were all \u03bcFD embryos. The remaining vortexed embryos were cultured in control medium with 6% avian white yolk (WY). Embryo production and transfer occurred across five replicates. Cows (n = 475) were synchronized using an Ovsynch protocol. They were administered GnRH on Day \u22129, PGF on Day \u22122, and GnRH on Day 0. Half of the cows received a CIDR (1.38 g progesterone) with the 1st GnRH injection. The CIDR was removed at the time of PGF treatment. Day 7 Grade 1 blastocysts were transferred fresh 7 days after the 2nd GnRH injection. Control and WY embryos were transferred as ipsilateral singles and bilateral twins; \u03bcFD embryos were transferred singly. Pregnancy was diagnosed with ultrasound between 41\u201346 days and confirmed between 60\u201390 days; fetal sexing confirmed that 95% of fetuses were female. Effects on embryo survival were analyzed by logistic regression. Chi-square analysis was applied to survival rates. Replication affected embryo survival (P < 0.05). There was no effect of cumulus removal, medium, or CIDR use. Fetal loss between ultrasounds was greater for twin vs. single transfers (30% vs. 15%, respectively; P < 0.01). Probability of embryo survival was estimated to increase \u223c0.006 with each increasing day postpartum. Five cases of hydrallantois were detected during the 5th month of gestation for 1 control twin, 1 WY single, and 3 WY twin transfers, originating from 3 replicates. On a production per transfer basis, the proportion of fetuses obtained for single and twin transfers was 30% and 55%, respectively (P < 0.001).

Liveborn progeny have been produced from several mammals, including sheep (1,2), cattle (3), rabbits (4), and pigs (5). Because nuclei from a single embryo possess genotypes originated by repeated copying (mitosis) of the DNA from the fertilization genome, each nucleus can theoretically be used as a template for producing multiple embryos of identical genotype. Although embryonic cells may have already progressed through the preimplantation phase, their developmental 'clock' can be reprogrammed back to 'time zero' of a fertilization genome by fusion with the cytoplasm of an enucleated secondary oocyte. Fusion with an enucleated oocyte also provides the critical cytoplasmic mass required for development and differentiation through the cleavage stages when there is no net growth of the embryo. The above features make nuclear transplantation a more powerful technique than the simple splitting of embryos to produce identical twins. However, despite the potential advantages this technique offers to both research and commerce, the complexity and inefficiency of some steps involved in producing nucleartransplanted embryos have led to its limited use by the embryo transfer industry (6, see reviews 7,8,9). The methodology used for the nuclear transplantation of embryos has been schematically presented below (Figure 1) and will be discussed with reference to possible means of increasing its efficiency.", "year": 1991, "openAccessPdf": null, "authors": [{"authorId": "152447421", "name": "L.

His characters are mostly ordinary people, yet their lives are shaped or changed by a larger historical context or by dramatic events beyond their control, and often, beyond their understanding. Swift\u2019s claim that literature brings us into contact with fire, yet we do not get burned, echoes Aristotle\u2019s notion of catharsis. To make this contact with fire possible, Swift selects easily recognizable ordinary areas of shared human experience, which bring the reader close to the protagonist, and simultaneously establish distance by deliberate indeterminacies and refusal to provide disambiguation. A paradoxical coexistence of identification with characters and an underlying sense of suspicion on the part of the reader produce a unique version of contemporary realistic narrative with its ethical and aesthetic commitment. Graham Swift\u2019s three most recent novels published over the last twelve years, The Light of Day (2003), Tomorrow (2007), and Wish You Were Here (2011), are like and unlike one another, a feature they share with Swift\u2019s earlier fiction. A recurrence of dominant themes of loss and mourning, which inform his writing, as well as the use of some typical strategies have been noted and discussed; what i shall attempt to do is to examine, in the context of each work, the construction of the openings and endings of the three novels, all of which span one day and go beyond this limit by excursions into the past and the imagined or anticipated future. The question underlying the examination of the past concerns its irreversibility: can a past-oriented life can also be future-oriented. The distinguishing feature is the choice of the narrator: typically for Swift, the first person and male in The Light of Day, untypically, and possibly, less successfully the first person female in Tomorrow, and the third person and the use of free indirect speech in the most recent novel. The tellers are placed in time and 74 Krystyna Stamirowska space, which define their field of vision and activity: the place in the two earlier novels is South London and in Wish You Were Here \u2013 the isle of Wight; the time is restricted to one day in the life of the protagonist; the dates are respectively: 20 November 1997, 17 June 1995, and November 2006 (Tom\u2019s death was on 4 November, his brother Jack learns about it in \u201cearly November\u201d). in each novel the narrative is preceded by an epigraph. in The Light of Day it is a familiar proverb \u201cAll\u2019s fair in love and war,\u201d ascribed to John Lyly\u2019s novel Euphues: The Anatomy of Wit, indicating a link between these two seemingly opposite areas of life. yet love and death, passion and violence are intimately and perversely associated, in life and in art; hence the use of similar images: in painting, in literature, in love poetry (donne or Marvell), and in opera (Carmen being perhaps the most striking example of love\u2019s deadly potential). Frustrated love sometimes turns into violence, and, as Bob\u2019s case demonstrates, can destroy its object. david Malcolm (2003) points out to the explicit connection Swift makes between the war in Croatia, which destroys Kristina\u2019s family; and Bob\u2019s death occasioned by his rejection of Sarah\u2019s love. (\u201cStreets in dubrovnik. in Croatian villages. All the pools of blood. Forget Wimbledon, forget Beechem Close\u201d 198). Additionally, we are also told that Bob\u2019s and Kristina\u2019s final walk at Heathrow Airport takes them through \u201ca battle zone.\u201d Another echo of the epigraph is George\u2019s speculation about what Kristina might have been living through during the war in Croatia: \u201cAtrocities on both sides. Fair\u2019s fair\u201d (107). The question \u201cWere we not weaned till then?\u201d which serves as an epigraph to Tomorrow is taken from donne\u2019s poem The Good Morrow celebrating spiritual love. re-contextualized and rephrased, it could also be asked by the narrator Paula, who spends a restless night, agonizing over what she and her husband Mike are about to reveal to their twin children in the morning. it is with reference to this prospect that Paula is re-examining her life and marriage, and repeats the words: \u201cAnd now, good morrow.\u201d in her seemingly very successful relationship with Michael there is a lot of John donne calls \u201ccountry pleasures,\u201d which implies the couple were not weaned; at least not in the sense suggested by the poem. The question form used by donne makes the poem more apposite to Swift\u2019s narrative than it would have been as a statement. Paula and Mike do not seem entirely weaned from the pleasures (of which they availed themselves in the past, with different partners), but this is not the point; and as such, the epigraph seems, in the context of the narrative, only loosely relevant and therefore more ornamental than organically connected. The couples\u2019 love may be solid enough, but it is hardly spiritual. remembering her early fascination with John donne, Paula repeats to herself: \u201c \u2018And now good morrow...\u2019 Will then tomorrow be a good morrow?\u201d The question, to our disappointment, is never answered. The most recent novel, Wish You Were Here, is preceded by an epigraph from Blake\u2019s poem, which, again is a question, \u201cAre these things done on Albion\u2019s shore?\u201d The original context for the expression of bewilderment is a punishment 75 The Use of Ambiguity and Inconclusive Endings in Graham Swift\u2019s Novels dealt by a deranged priest to a small boy (unfortunately, depicted in detail). The question connects with the first words uttered by the protagonist \u201cThere is no end to madness once it takes hold.\u201d Madness in the form of extreme irrational behaviour is as adequate a description of the fictitious priest\u2019s mindless cruelty, as indeed, it may seem the only explanation of some political events and decisions of the late twentieth century: the vast scale destruction of healthy cattle in Britain following mad cow disease, or various acts of terrorism. What connects the real and imagined victims are the recurring image of burning fire; which are now haunting Jack. it is also by fire that the little boy in Blake\u2019s poem dies. The three titles are somewhat misleading in the sense that they focus on the anticipation of the future: The Light of Day, when contextualized, turns out to refer to a distant future (at least eight years from now), when today\u2019s darkness may / will be replaced by light. Tomorrow, quite logically, is about anticipation of the day to come and speculation about what it will bring (not that we ever find out). one of the reviewers complains that tomorrow is about the past and the imagined future, but leaves out the present. Wish You Were Here connotes absence and loss; the phrase recurs like a refrain throughout the text and the you refers to two people: Jack\u2019s brother and his wife, and the narrative \u2013 in contrast to its predecessors \u2013 finds an unexpected, if only hypothetical, resolution at the end of the long day during which the protagonist, Jack, re-examines the dramatic events of the preceding 48 hours, and their antecedents belonging to the past, both recent and also, not so recent. it is not, however, that indeterminacy and a sense of inconclusiveness is entirely removed: the complex fusing of temporal dimensions (expressed by Future in the Past, Future Perfect in the Past, Present Simple, Past Simple) combined with and also, resulting from the uncertain status of the reported events leaves an area for doubt. The solidity of the happy ending is undermined by the intrusion of the supernatural, namely, the inexplicable double intervention of Jack\u2019s dead brother. is this to be taken at face value? Was this yet another illusion experienced by both Jack and Ellie who wished for reconciliation? or a pretext for reconciliation? This deliberate obscurity brings to mind Swift\u2019s interview with Patrick McGrath, published in 1988, in which, in the context of Waterland, he speaks of some elements of narrative \u201cdeliberately baffling to the reader\u201d and of a \u201cmixture of the intensely concrete and the world of ideas.\u201d Swift\u2019s favoured choice of temporal structure is the one-day framework of the present, recording the events, interrelated with two other temporal dimensions: the past and the anticipated future. The time shifts add to the difficulty of establishing what really happened, combined with some fluidity on the level of subjective, projected or imagined emotions, memories and decisions. This indeterminacy built into the narrative structure is confirmed by the ending. The reader is denied any ultimate revelation, and the significance of the clues, or what looks like clues, is, as it turns out, deferred for ever. Conventional expectations and 76 Krystyna Stamirowska answers to the question: what happened next? did they live happily ever after? are of course frustrated. Which is Swift\u2019s reading of the mimetic principle: there are no neat endings in human life; not even death can be experienced by the self, as this experience is reserved only for those left behind. despite Swift\u2019s commitment to mimesis, his own method of rendering experience prioritizes obscurity and ambiguity. The coexistence and blending together of the temporal perspectives impose a labyrinthian structure responsible for the reader\u2019s sense of uncertainty regarding the sequence (and therefore, causality) of events, especially when location also shifts without a warning; to the point when even a competent reader feels confused. yet, ultimately, the narrative offers a sense of catharsis as darkness opens up to light, in a way suggesting a light at the end of a tunnel: not very clear, perhaps illusive, but indicating that there may be hope. in his discussion of The Light of Day david Malcolm speaks of a \u201cnarrow way\u201d referring to Greene\u2019s The E", "year": 2015, "openAccessPdf": null, "authors": [{"authorId": "72688749", "name": "K.

A further 2.3 per cent of those remaining died before weaning and a further 1.1 per cent died from weaning to 15 months. Sixteen of 22 calves born as twins were perinatal mortalities. Perinatal losses were highest in purebred Zebus (Africander and Brahman) and in first generation Brahman crossbred (BX) calves. Africander crossbreds (AX) generally had the lowest mortality rates of all crossbreds at each stage of the life cycle. Perinatal mortalities were however high in both F1 AX and F1 BX calves born to primiparous purebred British (Hereford and Shorthorn) heifers. Over all crossbred generations, perinatal mortalities were highest in calves from 3-year-old heifers and decreased with age of dam. More males (4.7 per cent) than females (2.9 per cent) died at or near birth. Mortalities in F1 BX males (10.3 per cent) were the highest of all groups. Relatively high or low birth weight was associated with high perinatal mortalities in the crossbreeds. Losses of stock after weaning were generally higher in the British breed-types than in the Zebu breed-types with the greatest differences in adult mortality rates. Annual mortality rates of breeding cows of each breed were studied over a similar period. 9,537 cow years were involved in the study. Mortality rates of both purebred and crossbred British cows were higher than for purebred and crossbred Zebu cows. One contributing cause was the difference in numbers of cows of each breed that died while calving. In all, 1.4 per cent of British crossbred calvings resulted in the death of the cow compared with 0.6 and 0.3 per cent for comparable AX and BX cows. Losses were negligible in purebred Zebus.

Samples of jugular venous blood were collected serially at a mean of 57, 121, 192, and 234 d (range within groups was 20 d) after AI.

Maternal VEGF concentrations did not differ among collection times, but progesterone concentrations increased (P < 0.01) between d 192 and 234. Conversely, PAG concentrations were low at d 57 and 121 and did not differ between dams carrying singles or twins. However, the subsequent increase (P < 0.01) in PAG was greater in dams with twins, resulting in greater (P < 0.01) PAG concentrations for dams with twins at d 192 and 234 (type of birth x time; P < 0.01). Maternal IGF-I concentrations were unaffected by fetal number. Because corpora lutea persisted for the duration of the evaluation period, maternal progesterone concentrations were likely related to the number of corpora lutea rather than the number of fetuses. It is postulated that the greater PAG and VEGF concentrations in the blood of dams gestating twins are the result of a larger uteroplacental mass, including increased numbers of binucleate cells and increased angiogenesis and vasculogenesis associated with a twin pregnancy.

During 1998 only 10 of 17 calves identified in utero using ultrasonography at the Moose Research Center (MRC), Alaska, were born alive. An additional3 calves exhibited posterior lameness within 3 weeks following birth and 2 of the 3 subsequently died. These symptoms have been previously associated with white muscle disease. White muscle disease results from both vitamin E and selenium deficiencies. While whole blood and liver selenium levels in 3 animals with white muscle disease were above recommended levels, serum vitamin E (a-tocopherol) levels for MRC calves were lower than levels observed in free-ranging neonatal calves in interior Alaska (Tanana Flats). Furthermore, mean serum vitamin E levels in adult cows during March at the MRC (0.08 flg/ml) were alarmingly lower than free-ranging Tanana Flats moose (2.8 flg/ml). We observed vitamin E deficiencies in animals fed diets with 5 IU/kg feed. Our data suggest that clinical symptoms of vitamin E deficiencies in adult moose may be difficult to detect, unless animals are reproducing. Foil owing supplementation of vitamin E to 220 IU/kg in our pelleted ration during 1999, we observed no abortions and only 1 cow had still-born twin calves, but this was attributed to dystocia. Indeed, during 1999 only 2 of 16 calves identified in utero died ofnonpredation causes. Although a vitamin E deficiency in freeranging moose is unlikely, low selenium levels have been observed in free-ranging ungulate populations. Mean whole blood selenium levels in Tanana Flats moose (0.12 Jlg/g) were significantly lower than MRC adult cows (0.16 flg/g) fed a supplemented diet. More importantly, 8 of 10 animals from the Tanana Flats had selenium levels :5.0.085 flg/g and were below recommended levels for domestic cattle. Given the lack of data on soil selenium levels in Alaska, deficiency-related neonatal losses may occur that are attributed to other causes of mortality. It will be difficult to quantify in utero and neonatal calflosses resulting from selenium and vitamin E deficiencies ifblood or tissue samples from study locations are not examined.

To get new insights into molecular mechanisms underlying this complex dialog, a holistic transcriptome study of endometrium samples from Day 18 pregnant vs. nonpregnant twin cows was performed. This genetically defined model system facilitated the identification of specific conceptus-induced changes of the endometrium transcriptome. Using a combination of subtracted cDNA libraries and cDNA array hybridization, 87 different genes were identified as upregulated in pregnant animals. Almost one half of these genes are known to be stimulated by type I interferons. For the ISG15ylation system, which is assumed to play an important role in interferon tau (IFNT) signaling, mRNAs of four potential components (IFITM1, IFITM3, HSXIAPAF1, and DTX3L) were found at increased levels in addition to ISG15 and UBE1L. These results were further substantiated by colocalization of these mRNAs in the endometrium of pregnant animals shown by in situ hybridization. A functional classification of the identified genes revealed several different biological processes involved in the preparation of the endometrium for the attachment and implantation of the embryo. Specifically, elevated transcript levels were found for genes involved in modulation of the maternal immune system, genes relevant for cell adhesion, and for remodeling of the endometrium. This first systematic study of maternal transcriptome changes in response to the presence of an embryo on Day 18 of pregnancy in cattle is an important step toward deciphering the embryo-maternal dialog using a systems biology approach.", "year": 2006, "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://academic.oup.com/biolreprod/article-pdf/74/2/253/10564122/biolreprod0253.pdf", "status": "BRONZE"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "40495945", "name": "C.

In cows with follicles of pre-ovulatory size at insemination, twins can be avoided by puncturing and draining one follicle. In this report, we propose the use of a recently described manual method of follicular drainage without the need for ultrasound guidance and its association with treatment of the animal with human chorionic gonadotrophin (hCG), thus also increasing fertility compared to the use of Gonadotrophin releasing hormone (GnRH). The manual follicular drainage technique is simple, takes less than 1 min, and can be performed by a clinical veterinarian. In this study, even during heat stress periods follicle drainage plus hCG treatment gave rise to nearly 50% of pregnancies relative to conception rates, compared to 29% observed in non-drained, non-treated control animals or 20% in animals drained and treated with GnRH. This approach is recommended for weekly reproductive program visits. Abstract Twin pregnancies are undesirable in dairy cattle as they dramatically compromise cow lifespan and, consequently, herd economy. Clinical problems in cows arise from the time of pregnancy diagnosis to pregnancy loss, abortion, or parturition. The drainage of co-dominant follicles in cows with two or more follicles at insemination prevents twin pregnancy. The objective of this study was to compare the effectiveness of draining the smaller of two follicles through a simplified maneuver not requiring ultrasonography in cows in their third or more lactation, and then inducing ovulation immediately before artificial insemination (AI) with GnRH or human chorionic gonadotrophin (hCG). Animals were monitored by ultrasound at AI and randomly assigned to the groups: follicular drainage and treatment with GnRH (Deph; n = 60), follicular drainage and treatment with hCG (hCG; n = 60), and non-drainage (ND; n = 60) as control cows. On the basis of odds ratios, cows treated with hCG were 2.1 times more likely to become pregnant than control animals. Our results reveal the efficacy of hCG treatment at AI in cows with two follicles of pre-ovulatory size subjected to a simple follicular drainage procedure.", "year": 2021, "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://www.mdpi.com/2076-2615/11/1/169/pdf", "status": "GOLD"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "1398071668", "name": "I.

My brief discussion here will not attempt to survey all of the erythrocyte studies that may have bearing on tolerance phenomena, but will be largely a personal history of investigations that have not been adequately described in previous publications. Our point of departure will be the stable erythrocyte mixtures usually found in twin cattle (Owen 1945). It had been a general experience of the Wisconsin group working with immunogenetics of dairy cattle to observe an apparent identity of blood types in twin cattle much more often than would have been expected from the known frequency of identical twinning. The basis of this phenomenon was called prominently to our attention by a case of superfecundation, in which a pair of twins having sires of different breeds could each be shown to have a mixture of red cells of two different sorts, each type derived from one of the co-twins. Studies of these twins over a period of several years showed that the mixture was quantitatively stable in each twin\u2014a clear demonstration that erythrocyte precursors from each twin foetus had become established in the other and had conferred on their new host a tolerance toward these foreign cells that lasted throughout the life of the animal. We extended our studies to about 100 additional twin pairs, and to higher multiple births, including a set of quintuplet calves (Owen, Davis & Morgan 1946). Typically, the two cell types were found in approximately equal numbers in each twin, the proportion varying in different twin-pairs from 50-50 to 40- 60, with a few pairs well outside that range. When one cell type was in excess in one twin, the same type was commonly in excess in the other as well. There was therefore no evidence that the foreign cells were ever at any selective disadvantage. Furthermore, when the two zygotic types differed in antigens controlled by several independent genetic loci, there was never evidence of intermediate cellular constitutions. This appeared to rule out any possibility that transformation at the sub-cellular level occurs in the development of erythrocytes of cattle; the cells develop with complete autonomy, according to their particular genetic constitutions.", "year": 1956, "openAccessPdf": null, "authors": [{"authorId": "33239735", "name": "R.

Conclusions: Replacing two embryos in women under 37 and three in those aged 37 or more leads to a low multiple pregnancy rate while keeping at a good level our pregnancy rate. Additional transferred embryos, regardless of quality, increase the incidence of twins and triplets without improving the overall pregnancy rate. In older women, the transfer of three embryos has a low risk of triple pregnancy. Combined with our embryo freezing program, the ongoing pregnancy rate per oocyte retrieval is maintained as we reduce the number of fresh embryos replaced per transfer and consequently, the incidence of multiple pregnancies. and a 2-hour oral glucose loading test (75g) were performed the day before and after the course of clomiphene. Results: Ovulation was confirmed in 16/22 PCOS patients. Plasma levels of IGF-I decreased by 33.2% (442\u00b184ng/ml versus 292\u00b171ng/ml; p<0.05) after 5 days of clomiphene therapy, whereas plasma levels of IGFBP-I increased by about 29.5% (26.3\u00b14ng/ml versus 38.6\u00b17ng/ml; p<0.05). This gave a 58.5% reduction in the IGF-I:IGFBP-I ratio (21.9 versus 9.53). No significant changes in basal plasma concentrations of fasting insulin or area under the insulin curve were observed in response to oral loading. Conclusions: The present results show that clomiphene does not cause changes in insulin resistance associated with PCOS but reduces plasma levels of IGF-I and increases those of IGFBP-I, with a consequent marked reduction in the IGF-I:IGFBP-I ratio. Moreover, this study adds new information about the activity of clomiphene ovulation-induction in PCOS women. for 5 days and during 3 consecutive cycles (group B; n \u00bc 20) and metformin plus clomiphene for three consecutive cycles (group C; n \u00bc 20) with the same dosages as groups A and B.

The pregnancy rate was significantly higher in group C than in groups A and B (p<0.05), while there was not any difference between the latter two groups (p>0.05). Conclusions: Metformin may help restore spontaneous ovulation and improve menstrual cyclicity and increase the success rate of induction of ovulation with clomiphene citrate. Metformin plus clomiphene appears to be very effective for achievement of pregnancy compared to clomiphene citrate alone. (OHSS) is one of the complications of ovulation induction which may be correlated with insulin-resistance. This study is designed to determine the effect of metformin on the occurrence of OHSS and pregnancy in patients with PCOS who have indication of IVF. Materials and methods: In this prospective study, 46 patients with the diagnosis of PCOS who had indication of IVF were divided randomly into two groups. Patients in the case group (20 patients) underwent at least 8 weeks of metformin therapy and then long protocol for induction of ovulation. Patients in the control group (26 patients) underwent only long protocol of hypophysis suppression. After that, rate of OHSS and some other factors were assessed in both groups. Results: OHSS occurred in 7 patients (35%) of the case group and 11 patients (42.3%) of the control group; but there was no statistically significant difference. Fertilization rate (0.51\u00b10.3 versus 0.3\u00b10.19) and number of fertilized oocytes (4.7\u00b13.47 versus 2.65\u00b11.43) were significantly higher in the case group. There was no significant difference between two groups concerning the occurrence of chemical or clinical pregnancy, number of follicles, number of cleaved embryos, cancellation rate, number of oocytes and the mean size of follicles. The mean level of FSH in patients with OHSS was 4.35 (\u00b11.88) and in patients without OHSS was 5.49 (\u00b11.88) that were significantly different. Patients with or without OHSS did not differ in age, BMI and the levels of other hormones. Conclusion: Metformin has no effect on OHSS but it can improve fertilization rate and number of fertilized oocytes. OHSS occurs more often in patients with low levels of FSH. Age, BMI and the levels of LH, T3, T4 and TSH have no effect on OHSS. number of embryos transferred showed a signi- ficant association with the IVF outcome (p \u00bc 0.001). Discussion: Our study failed to show a correlation between the BMI and the serum hCG levels either at 12 or 36 hours following the hCG administration. Furthermore, no relationship was found between the serum hCG levels and the number of oocytes retrieved or the fertilization rate. The only factors that had an impact on the outcome were the number of embryos transferred. In our unit, women are strongly advised to normalize their weight prior to IVF treatment. Despite the results not showing any direct effect of BMI on IVF outcome, we feel that our practice should not change. It is important that women prepare their body for the stresses of pregnancy and labour in case their treatment is successful. Emphasis should therefore be placed on the potential adverse effects of abnormal body weight on the pregnancy outcome. Introduction: Recombinant LH (recLH) ovarian (OHSS) compared with the use of hCG. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) plays a role in the pathophysiology of OHSS and therefore applying recLH to trigger ovulation might be associated with lower level of VEGF production. This study was aimed to determine whether triggering of ovulation using recLH is associated with lower levels of VEGF in serum and follicular fluid. Materials and methods: In a prospective, randomized, double blind, double dummy study, 33 young patients undergoing IVF were given either recLH (1mg) or hCG (10,000 units) to trigger ovulation. In all patients, induction of ovulation using the long protocol was performed. VEGF levels were tested in follicular fluid on day of ovarian pick-up (OPU), and in serum on LH/hCG day OPU day and 6\u20138 days after OPU day. Results: A total of 21 patients received reLH and 10 received hCG. No significant difference was observed regarding age, mean amount of FSH used, mean estradiol level on day of LH/hCG and laboratory outcome. Preg- nancy rate per embryo-transfer were 43% and 38% in the recLH group and the hCG group, respectively. These differences were not statistically significant. No cases of severe OHSS were noticed in both groups, but there appeared to be a slight trend of reduction in moderate OHSS in the recLH group. Mean levels of VEGF in follicular fluid were 2484\u00b11234pg/ml in recLH group and 2777\u00b11003pg/ml in hCG group (P \u00bc NS). Mean levels of serum VEGF at LH/hCG, OPU and day 6\u20138 were 352, 370, 365pg/ml and 245, 270, 321pg/ml in recLH and hCG groups, respectively (P \u00bc NS). Conclusions: In this preliminary study, triggering of ovulation induction using recLH did not alter VEGF levels in follicular fluid and serum during the first week as compared with hCG. It seems that both hCG and recLH have a similar effect on ovarian production of VEGF during the first week after their admin- istration. The role of VEGF in the development of OHSS might be crucial only at a later stage of the cycle. Since no patient had severe OHSS in this small, prospective study, small differences in VEGF levels between the two groups were not significant. of the CRASH protocol, 1362IU versus 1595IU, although this difference did not have any significance. Blood samples revealed a rise in mean FSH from 3.88 (S1) to 10.37IU/l (hCG day), a constant mean LH level, 5.79IU/l (S1) versus 5.57IU/l (hCG day), a mean preovulatory estradiol level of 3.5nmol/l, a significant increase in inhibin B, 33.2pg/ml (S1) versus 205pg/ml (hCG day) and a preovulatory mean progesterone level of 1.8ng/ml. Conclusion: With the CRASH protocol low responders obtained clinical results comparable to those of normal responders. Endocrine parameters approached those of normal responders and suggest that this protocol could successfully be used in low responder patients. Introduction: Ultralong GnRH agonist (GnRH-a) therapy over the course of 6 months for severe endometriosis induces a hypogonadotrophic hormone constellation in which the ovaries cannot be optimally stimulated for ART cycles. Ovarian and uterine factors can be made responsible for this. The objective of the study was to compare the effectiveness of three different stimulation protocols: recFSH, recFSH plus recLH and HMG in ART cycles after prolonged GnRH-a therapy. Materials and methods: From January 2003 to January 2005 a controlled, prospective study in which 53 women were enrolled was carried out. All of the women had been operated because of stage III\u2013IV (ASRM) endometriosis and, starting on day 2 after the operation, were treated with GnRH-a in depot preparation over the course of six cycles. Two weeks after the final treatment with GnRH-a the women were assigned to one of the three stimula- tion protocols: recFSH (300IU), recFSH (225IU)+recLH (75IU) or HMG (300IU). ART treatment followed a conventional program with ovulation induction with recHMG and embryo transfer of two embryos 3 days", "year": 2005, "openAccessPdf": null, "authors": [{"authorId": "4103283", "name": "A.

The most common cause of difficulty in young cows, particularly heifers, is a disproportion between the size of the calf and the size of the birth canal of the dam. Seventy five percent of the time the difficult birth (dystocia) is due to the calf. The calf which should weigh from 6 to 10% of its dam's weight, may simply be too large. Such oversize is particularly likely when cows and heifers of breeds which have a relatively shorter gestation period, are bred to bulls of breeds with a longer gestation period. The genetic make-up of the calf determines its gestation period. Fetuses gain from 1 to 2 lb during the last 2 wk of gestation, hence the addition of 7 to 10 d may result in an extra 10 to 20 lb of body weight which in turn may make the difference between an unassisted vaginal delivery and a dystocia. The calf may also be at fault when it is presented abnormally in the birth canal, or when its posture (the extension of its head, neck and legs) is incomplete. Weak or dead calves do not participate in their delivery by lining up correctly and, as a result, frequently predispose the cow to calving difficulties. Twins occasionally try to enter the birth canal at the same time. Finally, some dystocias are due to malformations of the calf such as two-headed monsters, calves with ankylosed (\"frozen\") joints, spinal deformities and hydrocephaly. In 25% of the cases of calving difficulty the dam is at fault, especially when they are heifers. The pelvis may not have fully developed in heifers which were bred when they were too young. There are three additional potential areas of constriction of the birth canal, the cervix, the junction of the vagina and the vulva, and the lips of the vulva. Dystocia may also be due to such less common causes as torsion of the uterus or abortion of a large (dry) fetus accompanied by poor preparation of the birth canal, or pelvic deformities.", "year": 2021, "openAccessPdf": null, "authors": [{"authorId": "145557155", "name": "M.

For example, if living cells from a mouse of strain CBA are injected into an adult mouse of strain A, the CBA cells will be destroyed by an immunological process, and the A-line mouse that received them will destroy any later graft of the same origin with the speed to be expected of an animal immunologically forearmed. But if the CBA cells are injected into a foetal or newborn A-line mouse, they are accepted; more than that, the A-line mouse, when it grows up, will accept any later graft from a CBA donor as if it were its own. The experiment I have just described 1 can be thought of as an artificial reproduction of an astonishing natural curiosity, the phenomenon of red-cell chimerism in certain dizygotic twins. The blood systems of twin cattle before birth are not sharply distinct from each other, as they are in most other twins; instead, the blood systems make anastomoses with each other, with the effect that the twins can indulge in a prolonged exchange of blood before birth. A few years later R. Billingham and I 3 , with the help of three members of the scientific staff of the Agricultural Research Council, showed that most dizygotic cattle twins would accept skin grafts from each other, and that this mutual tolerance was specific, for skin transplanted from third parties was cast off in the expected fashion. We did not set out with the idea in mind of studying the immunological consequences of the phenomenon described by Owen; on the contrary, we had been goaded by Dr. Donald into trying to devise a foolproof method of distinguishing monozygotic from dizygotic twins, an enterprise that seemed reasonable enough against the rather thorough background of knowledge we already possessed about the behaviour of skin grafts in experimental animals 4. Brent, and I eventually succeeded in doing so, and our first report on the matter was published in 1. In the meantime M. It is now known that chimerism can occur naturally, though rarely, in twin sheep, and more rarely still in twin human beings 8 ; in twin chickens it is probably the general rule. Some properties of the tolerant state The main points that emerged from our analysis of the tolerant state were these. In the first place, tolerance must be due to an alteration of the host, not to an antigenic adaptation of the grafted cells, for grafts newly transplanted in adult life have no opportunity to adapt themselves, and the descendants of the cells injected into foetal or newborn animals can be shown by N. Once established, the state of tolerance is systemic; if one part of the body will tolerate a foreign graft, so will another; we found no evidence that a tolerated graft builds up a privileged position for itself within its own lymphatic territory. The stimulus that is responsible for instating tolerance is an antigenic stimulus \u00e2\u20ac\u201d one which, had it been applied to older animals, would have caused them to become sensitive or immune. A plural stimulus can induce plural tolerance; the donor will usually contain several important antigens that are lacking in the recipient, and long-lasting tolerance must imply tolerance of them all. The state of tolerance is specific in the sense that it will discriminate between one individual and another, for an animal made tolerant of grafts from one individual will not accept grafts from a second individual unrelated to the first; but it will not discriminate between one tissue and another from the same donor. The injection of leucocytes or lymphoid cells can confer tolerance of skin grafts, for example; and later work has shown that the same is true of grafts of thyroid tissue, ovary, kidney, and adrenal gland. These various tissues do indeed differ in their antigenic make-up, but not, apparently, in respect of antigens that play an important part in transplantation immunity. If leucocytes lacked some important antigen present in skin, it is difficult to see how they could confer tolerance of skin; and P. Krohn, using more direct and more critical methods, has found it impossible to distinguish between the antigenic make-up, so far as it governs their transplantability, of ovary and skin Tolerance can be brought promptly and permanently to an end by an experimental device which combines certain principles established by N. Please cast your mind back to the model experiment I described at the beginning of this lecture, and imagine an A-line mouse which is tolerant of CBA tissue and which carries a CBA skin graft as outward evidence that it is so. Here too, though much more slowly, the tolerant state is brought to an end. The inference we drew from this experiment \u00e2\u20ac\u201d and nothing has occurred since to make us question it \u00e2\u20ac\u201d was", "year": 2019, "openAccessPdf": null, "authors": []}

The circumstances behind the selection of a particular topic, vicissitudes of the research phase, personality of the author, and exchanges during the editorial process that bring it to publication together provide insight into the different layers of geographical scholarship. To all that can be added another dimension: explaining the impact that the piece of writing has had on individuals who have read it. One article in the Geographical Review profoundly affected the formation of my geographical imagination. It did so without appealing to any theory, showcasing some dazzling new technique, harboring an advocacy agenda, or exhorting the reader in any way. Now, nearly half a century after its publication, this text opened another level of reflection about its content, author, journal, editor, and changes in the place that was under study. A COMPELLING NARRATIVE The article at issue, written by James J. Parsons (1915-1997) and published in the Geographical Review (1962a), had as its evocative title \"The Acorn-Hog Economy of the Oak Woodlands of Southwestern Spain.\" It seamlessly commingled the study of landscape and livelihood in a Mediterranean environment having the twin constraints of summer drought and poor soils. Trees, mainly holm oak (Quercus ilex) and secondarily cork oak (Quercus suber), yielded kindling, the raw material for charcoal, cork, and at an earlier time tanbark. Periodic pruning increased the production of acorns that dropped from the oaks in the last quarter of the year. Of the livestock, pigs consumed most of this mast, whereas cattle and sheep primarily pastured on surrounding grasses. (1) About once every five years farmers plowed plots of ground between the trees and sowed them, mainly in winter wheat. Such an intervallic regime responded to the infertile soils that ruled out annual cultivation. Cultivation not only freed trees to grow larger and yield more acorns but also kept in check the spontaneous shrubby undergrowth that, if allowed to take over, provided fuel for devastating wildfires. Parsons explicitly articulated two main points that were original to him at the time: the interconnectivity of the various elements of the agro-silvo-pastoral system and its durable use of resources. If a land-use system could be described as demonstrating the beautiful logic of sustainability, this is it. Such an intricate use of the oak woodland--dehesa, as it is called in Spain--expanded during the Reconquista (722-1492), when Christians recolonized abandoned land and emphasized the keeping of swine that their former Muslim masters had eschewed. The landscape itself was one in which human activity determined the size, shape, and spacing of the oaks. It was a humanized landscape that could not be neatly split into \"natural\" versus \"cultural\" components. Except for the halftone showing a crop-dusting plane fumigating the woodland against a caterpillar invasion, the article's illustrations bespoke a preindustrial tradition. Somewhat puzzlingly, however, the title did not include Portugal, even though Parsons referred to it several times. In fact, Parsons took the evocative photograph of this parklike landscape across the international border in the Alentejo, near Evora in Portugal. AN EXTRAORDINARY FIELD GEOGRAPHER Jim Parsons, a full professor at the University of California, Berkeley when the article was published, conducted the research for this study during 1959 and 1960, a year in Spain funded by the Guggenheim Foundation. Leading up to that project, Parsons had spent more than a decade working on Latin America, starting with a dissertation project on the Antioquenos of Colombia. The published monograph that grew out of that effort went through two English and four Spanish editions (Parsons [1949] 1968). \u2026", "year": 2010, "openAccessPdf": null, "authors": [{"authorId": "20881214", "name": "D.

What was known and what unknown about transplantation immunology at the time? Both of these questions can of course be answered only in retrospect. We can certainly now say that very little was known. Probably the main thing that was known with any level of certainty was that graft rejection was an immunologic response. The demonstration by Medawar of memory in the rejection of skin allografts in rabbits proved this point. Interestingly, it was a point that had been made quite well many years earlier by Georg Sch\u00f6ne. Sch\u00f6ne published his insightful paper entitled \u201cUber transplantationsimmunit\u00e4t\u201d in 1912. The other thing that was well known was that suppressing the rejection of kidney grafts, both in man and experimental animals such as dogs, was impossible. Many authors had studied this intensively and had exhausted their ingenuity in their attempts to find a solution. As late as 1955, David Hume wrote \u201crenal homotransplantation has no place in the therapy of human patients at this time.\u201d He would only a few years later be a major player in establishing azathioprine as a key drug in launching kidney transplantation as a viable therapeutic procedure for chronic renal failure. One other thing in the background during Leslie\u2019s studies was the brilliant work of Peter Gorer. He established, using tumor transplantation studies in inbred mice, that a single genetic locus was primarily responsible for inducing tumor rejection. This genetic locus was, of course, what turned out to be the H-2 locus, also known as the mouse major histocompatibility complex (MHC). But the huge complexity of that locus, the existence of MHC class II antigens and the definition of the human MHC (HLA) were all basic matters for the future. In these circumstances, a field relies on chance rather than careful theorizing. That chance came in 1945 when Ray Owen published his remarkable observation that the majority of 80 pairs of cattle twins had identical blood groups. This was in spite of the fact that some of the twins were of unlike sex, and many twins of the same sex were phenotypically clearly not monozygotic. Several blood groups had been evaluated, so the chance that the dizygotic twins shared all alleles by chance was vanishingly small. Owen recalled the studies of Lillie in 1916, who showed that the majority of dizygotic cattle twins were synchorial, that is, they shared a single placenta and therefore shared a single blood circulation in utero. This phenomenon is rare in other species. Owen correctly hypothesized that the sharing of hematopoietic precursors (stem cells) in utero resulted in the cattle twins each having 2 sets of blood cells\u2014their own and that of their twin\u2014for all of their lives. This was a remarkable example of the induction of graft tolerance. It formed the basis of Burnet and Fenner\u2019s hypothesis that self tolerance was a consequence of the exposure of the immune system to self antigens in utero. However, very interestingly, it lay there largely unnoticed in the literature. The thing that fortuitously triggered interest in Owen\u2019s paper was the difficulty of defining monozygosity and dizygosity in cattle twins. The fact that both monozygotic (identical) and dizygotic (fraternal) twins shared all blood groups meant that the standard approach of blood group typing was of no value. One had to rely on physical characteristics, such as color patterns and hair whorls. HP Donald suggested to Peter Medawar that he perform skin grafts between the cattle twins, expecting (incorrectly as history has shown) that the monozygotic twins would accept their twin\u2019s skin graft while the dizygotic twins would reject them. As things turned out, both monozygotic and dizygotic twins completely accepted each other\u2019s grafts! What nobody had anticipated at the time is that the life-long acceptance of blood precursors from the twin would also induce tolerance to a tissue graft such as skin. We now know that such hematopoietic chimerism induces profound tolerance to the tissues of the stem cell donor. From here, it was a small step to reproduce in the laboratory what they had observed in nature. They injected CBA strain mouse embryos at the 15th or 16th day of gestation with lymphoid and other tissues from the A strain. At 8 weeks of age, the normal looking CBA mice were given a strain skin grafts\u2014and the majority showed complete tolerance. They accepted their skin grafts for life! At a bleak moment in the history of the clinical application of kidney transplantation, this study showed in a spectacular fashion that the spectrum of antigens that could be regarded as self was subject to experimental and therefore potentially to clinical manipulation to provide long-term graft acceptance. It sparked an absolutely huge amount of research over >50 years on transplantation tolerance.

Our diesel generator allows us to enjoy cool air only in the operating theatre. In the outpatients area I sweat, along with everyone else. An unrelentingly hot, humid working environment is not conducive to the General Medical Council's ideal of constant politeness and in-depth discussions of treatment options with my patients. \n \nOur target population is the rural community of farmers and cattle herders, most of whom exist in grinding poverty. They still live in houses of mud and wattle with thatched roofs. Their lives are dominated by the agricultural seasons: hoeing, sowing, weeding, and harvesting. Most do not read or write, watch television, or drive cars. Their horizons are local. \n \n \nMust we increase our charges to poor patients so we can pay someone to audit my work? \n \n \nMy specialty of ophthalmology is wonderfully satisfying in this part of the world. Every working day I restore sight to someone blinded by longstanding dense cataract. Over a year the number is in the thousands; over a career it adds up to the population of a reasonably sized town. There aren't many specialties as professionally rewarding as that. \n \nSo why am I practising single handed? Why aren't doctors falling over themselves to work alongside or in similar parts of rural Africa? After all, we all share a vocation to bring health care to those in need, don't we? In these post-Shipman days the term \u201csingle handed\u201d rings alarm bells. Teams\u2014that's what we need. Anyone who is single handed is suspect. \n \nFor Africa, Benin isn't short of ophthalmologists. Much of the continent has very few\u2014one per million people, on average. This is not so in Benin, which can boast more than 20 eye specialists for seven million people. Their distribution is the problem. Most work on the coast in the twin capitals of Porto Novo and Cotonou, 30 km apart. Outside these cities, and especially up here in the north, where most of the population lives, ophthalmologists are rare. \n \nThe scandal is that most doctors and medical students come from southern families, who have no interest in working in the north, where the climate is harsher and the languages unfamiliar. Another scandal is the paucity of training programmes for producing ophthalmologists to serve in French speaking Africa. Furthermore, relevant practical training that equips future ophthalmologists for work outside cities is lacking. Many francophone ophthalmologists, even after four years of training, are ill at ease in performing eye surgery. \n \nBecause I work in what is essentially a surgical eye service in a charity hospital with modest salaries and no opportunity for private practice, I'm not overwhelmed with offers from Beninois ophthalmologists to work with me. Worse, because their training has been oriented to practice in developed countries they have an overt disdain for ophthalmology adapted to poor communities. Who among my peers here would confirm to the GMC that I give \u201cgood clinical care\u201d? \n \nThe GMC relicensing will also require me to audit my surgical case load. With a huge and growing clinical workload I have no time to spend on auditing myself. We will have to employ a clerical officer to do the job, meaning an extra salary. Must we increase our charges to poor patients so we can pay the salary of someone to audit my work to satisfy the GMC? That some of the poorest people on this earth trek hundreds of kilometres to my clinic and struggle to pay the small fees we charge is an eloquent audit in itself. They wouldn't come so far if they hadn't heard that this is where blind people can be made to see. \n \nHow do I keep up to date? I get journals (BMJ, Medicine, Tropical Doctor, Eye, Journal of Community Eye Health among others), but out here we have no clinical meetings, workshops, or journal clubs. To attend the Royal College of Ophthalmologists' annual meeting I would need a return air ticket and a week in an expensive hotel. I managed it once, thanks to a BMA grant. The Christian Medical Fellowship (UK) runs an excellent two week residential refresher course. But does all that constitute a \u201clearning plan\u201d?

This is\u00a0 very important to remember when evaluating the milk quality and in the improvement of milk yield and composition in\u00a0 a dairy enterprise. Of the external factors it is possible to mention a few:\u00a0 litter size, duration of dry period and\u00a0 stage of pregnancy. The present discussion explores the significance of litter size, duration of dry period \u00a0and pregnancy on milk yield and composition in dairy production. In goats and sheep dams\u00a0 bearing twins or triplets had\u00a0 higher milk yield than single bearing dams, and this significant increase in milk production in these dams\u00a0 that carried twins and triplets was followed by an increase\u00a0 in lactation length. Due to the amount of milk animal produce, the drying-off process is often more complicated for dairy animals (cattle, goats and some sheep). However, this period is essential to enables dams to regain the body condition needed to support the subsequent pregnancy and lactation. The majority of dairy animals dry off spontaneously because of the aforementioned natural decrease in daily milk production. The length of dry period influences milk production in the subsquent lactation, with shortening\u00a0 of the dry period showing a markedly negative effect on milk performance of dams. Lactating animals should have an opportunity to rest and regenerate mammary tissue between lactations. F or optimal dairy animal performance in the next lactation, lactating animals should have an opportunity to rest and regenerate mammary tissue between lactations. The amount of produced milk and its composition are influenced by the stage of pregnancy: in the first half of pregnancy it is not possible to observe any pronounced changes while in the second stage of pregnancy can observe a gradual decrease in milk production as well as an imcrease in levels of individual milk components. During pregnancy and the first few days postpartum, milk supply is hormonally driven \u2013 this is called the endocrine control system . This implies that in the course of lactation, changes in milk production are caused by changes in activities of the endocrine system that are caused by hormones sectreted by pitiutary gland (hypophysis cerebi) and placenta. During the latter part of pregnancy, the mammary gland is\u00a0 making colostrum, but high levels of progesterone inhibit milk secretion resulting reduced milk yield.\u00a0 Progesterone influences the growth in size of alveoli and lobes; high levels of progesterone inhibit lactation before birth. Progesterone levels drop after birth; this triggers the onset of copious milk production. Estrogen\u00a0 stimulates the milk duct system to grow and differentiate. Like progesterone, high levels of estrogen also inhibit lactation, while the hormone prolactin must be present for milk synthesis to occur.", "year": 2014, "openAccessPdf": null, "authors": [{"authorId": "66547371", "name": "N.

Dickerson (1978) estimated that 56% of the total feed energy intake for adult and market cattle is required solely for body maintenance (the non-productive energy requirement rises to 73% when replacements are considered). He also estimated that increasing reproductive rate from 0.8 to 1.8 could reduce the feed energy required by 25% per kg of edible meat protein. Preliminary experimental results from embryo transfer (Dickerson et al. 1988) and genetic studies (Gregory et al. 1990) show that gains of this order seem possible. The Meat Research Corporation (MRC) has sponsored a co-ordinated project on the application of advanced reproductive technology in temperate zone cattle which has focussed on beef twinning. While twinning has been the subject of a number of reviews (e.g. Hendy and Bowman 1970, Gordon 1983 and Morris 1984), the major stimuli for the current project were the finding that immunisation with ovarian follicular fluid (Cummins et al. 1986) and purified inhibin (Bindon et al. 1988) could stimulate multiple ovulation in cattle and from the development (Lu et al. 1987) and cornmercialisation of in vitro fertilisation and embryo transfer to induce twinning by Ovamass Ltd in Ireland.

A companion paper (1) presents the estimates of the effect of the drug on production parameters. Recombinant bovine somatotropin was found to increase the risk of clinical mastitis by approximately 25% during the treatment period but there was insufficient data to draw firm conclusions about the effects of the drug on the prevalence of subclinical intra-mammary infections. Use of rBST increased the risk of a cow failing to conceive by approximately 40%. For cows which did conceive, there was no effect on services per conception and only a small increase in average days open (5 days). Use of the drug had no effect on gestation length, but the information about a possible effect on the risk of twinning was equivocal. Cows treated with rBST had an estimated 55% increase in the risk of developing clinical signs of lameness. Few studies reported data on culling, but based on those that did, there appeared to be an increase risk of culling evident in multiparous cows.

The cattle embryos showed a head-totail length of 17 mm. to 860 mm. which, according to Zietschmann and Krolling (1955), corresponds to an embryo age of 28 to 320 days. The embryos were taken from the pregnant uterus. The extraction of embryo blood succeeded after the separation of the head from the body through the pressing of the cut blood vessels into a small Petri dish containing saline, modified Rous Turner solution, or Alsevers sodiumcyanid solution, After repeated washing of the blood cells in saline, the necessary 2.5 per cent solution could be produced and was tested with a set of 36 different blood-group reagents resulting from the immunization of cattle. The blood-group factors in consideration belong to 9 different blood-group systems of cattle, i.e. A, B, C, F/V, J, L, M, SU, and Z systems. In particular the following blood-group factors were tested: A, H, B, G, K, I, 01, 0 3 , P, Q, T i , T(z, D\u2019, Y\u2019, E\u2019Q , I\u2019, K\u2019, O\u2019, Cz , R, W, L\u2019, Xi , Xz , F, V, J, L, M, S, H\u2019, U1, U\u2019, Z, Z\u2019. For the analysis of either serum or plasma the blood was collected in tubes without anti-coagulative additions or with Alsever solution. The Rous-Turner solution is not suitable, as the formalin content denatures the beta-globulins, so that these cannot be shown in starchgel electrophoresis. In the immunhemolysis test the blood from 500 embryos of different age levels were tested for their blood factors. In this material we found 9 pairs of twins of the same and different sex in sizes from 28 mm. to 650 mm. With the help of starch-gel electrophoresis (Gahne, 1960) 200 fetal sera were tested for their beta globulins or serum-transferrin groups. The particular blood group factors of the B and C systems of an individual could be determined to certain indivisible hereditary units without trouble. These could be associated with the so-called phenogroups already known in cattle of the highland breeds. The regularity of the linear subgroups was constantly maintained. Embryos, homozygote negative in the F/V-system, were not determined; they were either homozygote F/F or V/V or heterozygote F/V. The blood-group tests indicated that blood-group factors could be already shown in embryos with a head to tail length of 17 mm. which, according to Zietschmann and Krolling (1955), corresponds to an age of 4 to 5 weeks. This was the youngest cattle embryo tested. I t was not possible to collect enough blood for testing from a 15-mm.long embrya. One can easily obtain blood cells from embryos less than 20 mm. for testing, but the extraction of serum for serum-protein testing meets with difficulty.

The overall hypothesis is that pregnancy rate in heat-stressed lactating cows can be improved by use of embryo transfer and that additional gains in pregnancy rate can be achieved through development of procedures to cryopreserve embryos, select embryos most likely to establish and maintain pregnancy after transfer, and to enhance embryo competence for post-transfer survival through manipulation of culture conditions. The original specific objectives were to 1) optimize procedures for cryopreservation (Israel/US), 2) develop procedures for identifying embryos with the greatest potential for development and survival using the remote monitoring system called EmbryoGuard (Israel), 3) perform field trials to test the efficacy of cryopreservation and the EmbryoGuard selection system for improving pregnancy rates in heat-stressed, lactating cows (US/Israel), 4) test whether selection of fresh or frozen-thawed blastocysts based on measurement of group II caspase activity is an effective means of increasing survival after cryopreservation and post-transfer pregnancy rate (US), and 5) identify genes in blastocysts induced by insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) (US). In addition to these objectives, additional work was carried out to determine additional cellular determinants of embryonic resistance to heat shock. There were several major achievements. Results of one experiment indicated that survival of embryos to freezing could be improved by treating embryos with cytochalasin B to disrupt the cytoskeleton. An additional improvement in the efficacy of embryo transfer for achieving pregnancy in heat-stressed cows follows from the finding that IGF-1 can improve post-transfer survival of in vitro produced embryos in the summer but not winter. Expression of several genes in the blastocyst was regulated by IGF-1 including IGF binding protein-3, desmocollin II, Na/K ATPase, Bax, heat shock protein 70 and IGF-1 receptor. These genes are likely candidates 1) for developing assays for selection of embryos for transfer and 2) as marker genes for improving culture conditions for embryo production. The fact that IGF-1 improved survival of embryos in heat-stressed recipients only is consistent with the hypothesis that IGF-1 confers cellular thermotolerance to bovine embryos. Other experiments confirmed this action of IGF-1. One action of IGF-1, the ability to block heat-shock induced apoptosis, was shown to be mediated through activation of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase pathway. Other cellular determinants of resistance of embryos to elevated temperature were identified including redox status of the embryo and the ceramide signaling pathway. Developmental changes in embryonic apoptosis responses in response to heat shock were described and found to include alterations in the capacity of the embryo to undergo caspase-9 and caspase-3 activation as well as events downstream from caspase-3 activation. With the exception of IGF-1, other possible treatments to improve pregnancy rate to embryo transfer were not effective including selection of embryos for caspase activity, treatment of recipients with GnRH.and bilateral transfer of twin embryos. In conclusion, accomplishments achieved during the grant period have resulted in methods for improving post-transfer survival of in vitro produced embryos transferred into heat-stressed cows and have lead to additional avenues for research to increase embryo resistance to elevated temperature and improve survival to cryopreservation. In addition, embryo transfer of vitrified IVF embryos increased significantly the pregnancy rate in repeated breeder cows.", "year": 2007, "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://naldc.nal.usda.gov/download/7587730/PDF", "status": "BRONZE"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "145318538", "name": "P.

Medawar,7 who had already shown that dizygotic twin cattle were mutually tolerant of homografts of each other's skin8 9 and had expressed their determination to reproduce this strange state of affairs by artificial means. In short, they found that mice or chickens of different strains or breeds could be caused to accept skin homografts from each other in adult life, provided they had been injected in embryonic life with cells taken from their future donors, or from animals antigenically similar to their future donors. A detailed analysis of the phenomenon3 has shown, among other things, that actively acquired tolerance is highly specific, in the sense that an animal which has been caused to become unreactive towards one antigen will retain in full its power to react against any other; and that it is due to some kind of central failure of the machinery of reaction, for normal reactivity can be restored to a \" tolerant \" animal simply by re-equipping it with normal lymphoid cells. It is clear then that Burnet and Fenner's concept holds good for transplantation immunity, and the work of Owen and of M. Hasek'0 shows that it applies equally well to the immunological reactions provoked by red blood corpuscles. It is demonstrable, then, with immunological reactions of two entirely different types, for, as Medawar pointed out when opening the Royal Society discussion, transplantation immunity and red-cell immunity could hardly be more unlike. But does the concept hold good for still other immunological systems ? There are some grounds for believing that it does. Several groups of immunologists\"-4 have shown that rabbits which have been injected with protein antigens from birth onwards lose-or rather never acquire-the power to make antibodies against those antigens when challenged to do so in adult life. The state of non-reactivity seems to persist after the disappearance of the antigen that produced it, a property which distinguishes it from immunological paralysis, which is now generally thought to be due to the persistence of antigen in excess.'5 There is some evidence, too, of the production of tolerance by the injection of bacterial antigens.16 17 The term is perhaps unfortunate in this context, because tolerance might here be thought to bear the more usual connotation of \" putting up with\" virulent micro-organisms, the very faculty of which tolerance in its technical sense would deprive them. But then there has always been something rather odd about the semantics of immunology. Other investigators, injecting antigens of various kinds into the embryos of chicks or rats, have not succeeded in demonstrating any subsequent impairment of. response.\"8 The recent work of M. Simonsen19 may go some way towards explaining why they have failed. All investigators intent upon securing tolerance have been on their guard against injecting their antigens too late in life; Simonsen's work shows that an injection may also fail if it is done too early. Presumably there is some critical period of maturation during which the injection of an antigen will prevent the development of the power of response: if nonliving antigens are injected too early, they may be disposed of before that period begins. The papers delivered at the Royal Society's meeting give a foretaste of the uses to which the technique of inducing tolerance can be put. R. J. C. Harris, for example, has used it in a way that throws important light on the antigenic make-up of the Rous sarcoma virus, and H. Koprowski and his colleagues have used it to cultivate mouse tumours in alien strains, a process which leads to deep-seated cellular transformations of a type which should be studied by all who dream of a genetic theory of asexually reproducing adult cells. The phenomenon of tolerance is not yet explicable by any chemical theory of the immunological response; on the contrary, its ability to explain the phenomenon of tolerance will be a crucial test for the adequacy of any theory that immunochemists may eventually devise.", "year": 1957, "openAccessPdf": null, "authors": [{"authorId": "1397556515", "name": "E.

An experimental study on the effects of gonad grafts in the embryo chick was undertaken in an attempt to reproduce the results obtained by Minoura and to define the bearing of this experiment on Lillie9s theory of the free-martin in cattle. 2. Eggs from a sex-linked cross were used so as to be able to identify the original sex of the embryos. 3. In the majority of cases the egg received the graft at the seventh day of incubation and was examined at the seventeenth day, at which stage the progress of sexual differentiation is almost as complete as at the time of hatching. 4. In all 540 embryos were operated on. Of this number 233 received testis grafts and 168 ovary grafts. Other tissues grafted were thyroid, adrenal, pancreas, spleen, gall-bladder, liver, Wolffian body, kidney, lung, lens, and heart. 5. The age of the grafted tissue varied from the fourteenth day of incubation up to ten weeks old. 6. Of the gonad grafts, 150 survived the operation, 71 \u2642 and 79 \u2640. 47 \u2640 chicks were obtained after testis grafts, and 27 \u2642 chicks were obtained after ovary grafts. Healthy active testis grafts were found in 20 \u2640 and 5 ovary grafts in \u2642. 7. The sex ratio in the surviving chicks showed no deviation from the normal. 8. Macroscopical examination of the urogenital system showed no deviation from the typical structure consonant with the sex of the chick as determined by its plumage colour. 9. Microscopical examination of the gonads revealed no abnormalities in histological structure. 10. These results lend no confirmation to the view that the process of sexual differentiation in the chick can be profoundly modified by the specific physiological activity of a gonad graft of the opposite sex. 11. Minoura9s interpretation of his results are criticised. 12. The grafting of gonad tissue in the embryo chick does not reproduce experimentally the conditions existing in the bovine free-martin in that in the former the embryo is exposed to the specific action of the grafted gonad alone, whereas in the latter the female co-twin is exposed to the action of all the internal secretions from the male.", "year": null, "openAccessPdf": null, "authors": [{"authorId": "87048579", "name": "A.

In light of the known elevation of this growth factor during bovine lactation, a study was now designed to evaluate the possible role of this biochemical phenomenon in human double ovulation. Research Aim: To examine the relationship of human spontaneous twinning with a history of prior lactation. Methods: Through published announcements and randomly distributed questionnaires, volunteers were sought who had previously delivered viable gestations at least twice. Mothers of spontaneously conceived singletons, twins, and/or triplets who had delivered viable gestations in at least two separate pregnancies were included. These women were asked to supply anonymously retrospective information about their breast-feeding history in pregnancies. Data from the most recent gestations were separated by final delivery size (singletons versus multiples). The total duration of breast-feeding in prior pregnancies was noted and segregated by whether the nursing had been exclusive or combined with cow\u2019s milk or formula by bottle. Statistical significance of prior breastfeeding versus bottle/feeding was confirmed. Results: On average, women delivering twins or triplets had exclusively breast-fed more often (71.4% vs . 17.2%) and longer (21.4 vs . 8.6 months) in total in their previous pregnancies than those giving birth to singletons (p<.001). Furthermore, mothers who themselves had been breastfed as neonates were more likely to conceive multiples as adults. Conclusion: The chance of twinning in later gestations appears to correlate with the total duration many women lactated in earlier pregnancies. The longer and the more exclusively these gravid as had breast-fed previous neonates, the greater was their likelihood of twinning in their most recent pregnancy.

A total of 476 multiparous non-suckling Bos taurus females (body condition scores of 2.9\u2009\u00b1\u20090.4 on 1 to 5 scale) were oestrous synchronized with 2\u2009mg of oestradiol benzoate (IM) and a 1.9-g intravaginal progesterone release device (Day \u201311), which was removed on Day \u20132, followed by 0.48\u2009mg of sodium cloprostenol, 400\u2009IU of eCG, and 0.5\u2009mg of oestradiol cypionate (IM). In experiment I [no heat detection (HD), or no HD, n\u2009=\u2009387], TAI was carried out 48\u2009h later (Day 0), whereas in experiment II (after HD, n\u2009=\u200989), AI was performed 12\u2009h after the onset of oestrus up to 48\u2009h after intravaginal insert removal, when remaining females were inseminated (Day 0). Day-7 blastocysts produced by IVF from abattoir-derived oocytes were individually transferred (TET) 7 days after TAI (Day 7) to 186/387 and 44/89 females in experiments I and II, respectively, ipsilateral to the corpus luteum. Then, fertile mature Bos taurus bulls were introduced on Day 12 into the herds (1:25) up to Day 90. Determinations of pregnancy outcome after TAI, TAI+TET or natural mating, twinning rates, and pregnancy losses were done by ultrasonography and rectal palpation on Days 30, 60, and 125. Data were analysed by the Chi-squared test (P\u2009<\u20090.05). Pregnancy rates (Day 30) were lower after TAI (104/201, 51.7%) than after TAI+TET (126/186, 67.7%) with no HD (experiment I), but similar between TAI (32/45, 71.1%) and TAI+TET (30/44, 68.2%) after HD (experiment II). Twinning rates were lower in TAI groups with no HD (6/104, 5.8%) and after HD (2/32, 6.2%) than in TAI+TET groups with either no HD (42/126, 33.3%) or with HD (14/30, 46.7%). Overall pregnancy was similar between groups after the end of the breeding season: 90.0% (181/201) and 90.3% (168/186) for TAI and TAI+TET with no HD, and 84.4% (38/45) and 84.1% (37/44) for TAI and TAI+TET after HD. Pregnancy losses were higher after TAI+TET with no HD (27/126, 21.4%) than TAI+TET after HD (3/30, 10.0%), and TAI with (2/32, 6.3%) or without (9/104, 8.7%) HD. The TAI+TET with no HD resulted in fewer fetuses per served (0.69) and pregnant (1.30) female than TAI+TET after HD (0.89 and 1.44), whereas TAI with no HD had fewer fetuses than TAI after HD per served (0.50\u2009v. 0.69) but not per pregnant female (1.05\u2009v. 1.03), with both being lower than the TAI+TET groups. In summary, TET after TAI with no HD increased pregnancy and twinning rates. Also, heat detection increased pregnancy rates after TAI and twinning rates after TAI+TET. The TAI+TET combination may be advisable for reproductive schemes with no HD, whereas no benefit of TAI+TET was seen over TAI regarding pregnancy rate if TAI is coupled with HD, but HD may increase prolificacy after TAI+TET. The economics of the use of TAI+TET is under evaluation, by assessing calving, weaning, and postnatal weight gain rates between groups.", "year": 2018, "openAccessPdf": null, "authors": [{"authorId": "1441270892", "name": "G.

For height at withers, the results were similar to those for weight. 4. The contribution of environmental variance to total intrapair variance increased from a0 to a3, while that due to additive genetic effects diminished. Owing to the wide fiducial limits applicable, the results can be accommodated assuming only additive genetic effects in addition to environmental effects as estimated from one-egg twins.

However, very little is known about the effect of splitting on embryo development and competence. Indeed splitting could provoke a negative effect on embryo survival and it can be presumed that each demi-embryo might respond differently to the injury. In this sense, even when embryos are genetically and morphologically identical at the moment of splitting, their developmental potential and molecular characteristics might change as a consequence of the intense manipulation or epigenetic differences due to the interaction with the environment. We have proposed an approach to evaluate the effect of blastocyst splitting on the morphological and gene expression in in vivo development up to the filamentous stage. For that, the effect of splitting on bovine embryo development was evaluated during the elongation period by transferring split and nonsplit IVF-derived blastocysts to cattle recipients and collecting them at Day 17 of development. The number of collected embryos, embryo size, and global gene expression was compared between both groups. Collected elongated embryos derived from split blastocyst were compared with time matched collected control embryos. From 14 transferred hemi-embryos, 5 (35.7%) were collected while 9 elongated from 17 controls were recovered (52.9%). Neither the recovery rate nor the average length of the elongated embryos was significantly different between the two treatments. However, when embryos were rated depending on their size, more than 50% of embryos from the control group had a length surpassing 100\u2009mm, while only 33% of the split embryos reached that size. Global gene expression was performed using 2-colour microarray-based gene expression analysis. This was a whole-genome microarray study comparing 10 individual elongated embryos derived from split and nonsplit IVF blastocysts. Genes were considered differentially expressed if the fold change is greater than 2 (up or down-regulation) with P\u2009\u2264\u20090.05. A total of 29\u2009585 transcripts were detected in all embryos. From those, 449 (1.5%) were differentially expressed between elongated embryos derived from split and nonsplit IVF blastocysts, among them, 248 (0.83%) genes were down-regulated and 201 (0.67%) genes were up-regulated in split embryos. Gene ontology analysis identified deregulated genes related with intrinsic component of membrane (ELOVL7, GJA1, LAPTM4B, LDLR, SLC18A2, SLC1A3, SLC38A5, TSPAN13), lipid transporter activity (RBP4, APOA1, MTTP), and organophosphate ester transport (GJA1, GJB1, ATP9B). In conclusion, we showed that splitting affect the in vivo developmental capability and gene expression profile during the elongation period of bovine embryos. However, further studies are needed to determine the long-term effect of this technique to produce viable offspring.

This discrepancy suggests a particular pathogenic role for this type in the newborn calf. Artificial infection of calves presents no difficulty if the animal has been deprived of colostrum, but is only rarely successful with calves that have been given colostrum. The author's experiments show that calves can be infected if the organism is given immediately after birth and if the giving of colostrum is considerably delayed or if the calf keeps its newborn agammaglobulinemia despite receiving the colostrum. In one case of twin calves artificially infected the authors present evidence which supports this hypothesis. \n \n \n \nResume \n \nLa pathogenie de la septicemie colibacillaire chez le veau. V.

They speculated that \u201cthe organism possesses certain contrivances by means of which the immunity reaction, so easily produced by all kinds of cells, is prevented from working against the organism\u2019s own elements\u201d (1). These contrivances, known collectively as immunological tolerance, are now defined as the absence of an immune response against a specific antigen or cell after a sufficient immune stimulus is given. The tolerant individual should be fully able to mount a response to all other antigens. \n \nThe idea that specific immune unresponsiveness might reflect an acquired biological condition was surmised by Owen in 1945 (2). Owen observed that dizygotic twins of cattle have hematopoietic stem cells of both twins in the circulation, owing presumably to their exchange of hematopoietic stem cells (2), a striking observation given the immunogenicity of hematopoietic precursors by the twin fetuses (3). Billingham et al. deliberately induced hematopoietic chimerism in fetal and newborn animals, thereby demonstrating that tolerance induced by chimerism allows the permanent engraftment of skin from the hematopoietic cell donor (4). Why would foreign hematopoietic cells in Ehrlich\u2019s goats give rise to immunity, while foreign hematopoietic cells in Owen\u2019s cattle give rise to tolerance? The simplest answer is that the fetal immune system is poised for the induction of tolerance, whereas the mature immune system is poised for the induction of immunity. This answer is not entirely satisfactory, however, because the fetus can respond immunologically to certain antigens (e.g., transplacental infections give rise to specific IgM antibodies) and because in mature individuals the repertoire of lymphocytes, being continuously regenerated, must be subject to ongoing induction of tolerance under conditions in which immunity might be induced. An alternative view, then, is that foreign hematopoietic cells stimulate tolerance in developing lymphocytes and immunity or immune regulation (deletion, anergy, or suppression) in mature lymphocytes. In mature individuals, it is the balance of tolerance, immunity, and immune regulation that dictates the intensity and duration of the response. \n \nSeveral investigators have recently reported that the administration of bone marrow cells expressing Gal\u03b11-3Gal into lethally irradiated Gal-deficient mice induces tolerance to Gal (5, 6). Gal\u03b11-3Gal is a saccharide expressed by lower mammals but not by humans and higher primates. Species that do not express this sugar have natural anti\u2013Gal\u03b11-3Gal antibodies that are thought to initiate the rejection of vascularized xenografts (7). Given the intensity of humoral responses to Gal\u03b11-3Gal, it is postulated that tolerance to this sugar might contribute to the clinical application of xenotransplantation (8, 9). In this issue of the JCI, Ohdan et al. report that tolerance to Gal\u03b11-3Gal can be induced by hematopoietic chimerism (10). To investigate tolerance by chimerism, Ohdan infused wild-type murine bone marrow cells expressing Gal\u03b11-3Gal into mice that do not express \u03b1Gal because of targeted disruption of the gene encoding \u03b11,3-galtransferase (\u03b11,3GT), the enzyme that catalyzes synthesis of Gal\u03b11-3Gal. These mice, like humans, make antibodies against Gal\u03b11-3Gal. To allow engraftment of foreign bone marrow cells, the \u03b11,3GT mice were treated with a sublethal dosage of whole-body irradiation and with anti\u2013T cell antibodies. The treated mice accepted the bone marrow grafts, had a notable reduction of anti\u2013Gal\u03b11-3Gal antibodies, and did not reject subsequently implanted Gal\u03b11-3Gal+ hearts. If it is not the first report on the induction of tolerance to Gal by hematopoietic chimerism (5, 6), why should Ohdan\u2019s work warrant attention and commentary? The answer is that this report begins to explore what may be more important questions: how much tolerance is enough, and how much is too much.", "year": 1999, "openAccessPdf": {"url": "http://www.jci.org/articles/view/7850/files/pdf", "status": "BRONZE"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "3253599", "name": "J.

There's a new fantasy phenomenon for 2014 - The Golden Cage is the third enchanting tale in J. D. Oswald's epic fantasy series, The Ballad of Sir Benfro. Queen Beulah is determined to have her war, despatching Inquisitor Melyn north, through the ancient forest to cross unseen into the land of her enemies. Battling the ever growing influence of Magog, Benfro struggles to resist the treacherous orders of the long dead Dragon Mage, a task made yet more difficult by the arrival of Errol in his forest refuge. His body broken, Errol is tormented by dreams of his beloved Martha, imprisoned in a Golden Cage. He has escaped from King Ballah's torture chamber but remains powerless to help her. Yet fate has united these two. Errol holds the key to halting Magog's influence, and Benfro has the skill to heal broken bones. Working together they might survive. Apart, they will surely perish, and all Gwlad with them. The Ballad of Sir Benfro is an utterly compelling and beautifully written new fantasy series from J.D. Oswald. Fans of the Inheritance Series and readers hooked to the world of George R. R. Martin's Game of Thrones series will love the magic of the Twin Kingdoms. The Golden Cage is the third book in the series, following Dreamwalker and The Rose Cord, which are also published as Penguin eBooks.

Although the incidence of this biological anomaly in cattle is low, it is likely that such creatures were observed from time to time in the Nile Valley. The case for a mutant bull is supported by pictures of modern ischiopagi, veterinary references, Nubian petroglyphs, and hieroglyphic signs. The portrayal of a mutant animal on predynastic palettes is not unprecedented. \nCapart and Fischer suggested that the double bull was an early hieroglyph, but neither explained how or why it became a determinative in verbs meaning \u201cto move back and forth.\u201d It is possible that it was inspired by the back and forth grazing movement of a real double bull. The proposal would seem consistent with Frankfort\u2019s observation about the profound influence of cattle on the ancient Egyptian language. The double bull hypothesis may also elucidate the puzzling association of such a creature with a canal in the Third Upper Nome of Egypt. \nOther objects representing the double bull\u2014amulets, seals, a macehead, etc.\u2014are attested intermittently from the Predynastic to the Late Period when the amulet is rendered in the form of a \u201cdouble Apis;\u201d generally these objects have apotropaic connotations. Texts containing the double bull determinative exist more or less in parallel with the representational forms and maintain the same meaning throughout. The paper ends with a consideration of the Hunters\u2019 Palette as an exhibit of military power. \n\u00a0

To decipher the genetic architecture of this trait in the two Swiss Brown Swiss cattle populations, we performed various association analyses based on de\u2010regressed breeding values. Genome\u2010wide association analyses were executed using ~600\u2009K imputed SNPs for the maternal multiple birth trait in ~3500 Original Braunvieh and\u2009~7800 Brown Swiss animals. Significantly associated QTL were observed on different chromosomes for both breeds. We have identified on chromosome 11 a QTL that explains ~6% of the total genetic variance of the maternal multiple birth trait in Original Braunvieh. For the Brown Swiss breed, we have discovered a QTL on chromosome 15 that accounts for ~4% of the total genetic variance. For Original Braunvieh, subsequent haplotype analysis revealed a 90\u2010kb window on chromosome 11 at 88 Mb, where a likely regulatory region is located close to the ID2 gene. In Brown Swiss, a 130\u2010kb window at 75 Mb on chromosome 15 was identified. Analysis of whole\u2010genome sequence data using linkage\u2010disequilibrium estimation revealed possible causal variants for the identified QTL. A presumably regulatory variant in the non\u2010coding 5\u2032 region of the ID2 gene was strongly associated with the haplotype for Original Braunvieh. In Brown Swiss, an intron variant in PRDM11, one 3\u2032 UTR variant in SYT13 and three intergenic variants 5\u2032 upstream of SYT13 were identified as candidate variants for the trait multiple birth maternal. In this study, we report for the first time QTL for the trait of multiple births in Original Braunvieh and Brown Swiss cattle.

Ultrasonography is now commonly used for fetal sexing and early embryonic detection. Ultrasound offers researchers the ability to visually characterize the uterus, fetus, ovary, corpus luteum (CL), and follicles and has been used to monitor the growth and atresia of individual antral follicles, which usually takes place in two or three waves during the estrous cycle. We recently determined by ultrasonography that the diameter of the ovulatory follicles prior to the second injection of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) in a COSynch estrous synchronization system was related to overall pregnancy rates (PR). Cows that had follicles > 12 mm had greater (P<0.01) PR than those with follicles = 12 mm. In addition, cows that had follicles from 16.0 to 17.9 mm had the greatest (P<0.01) PR. With ultrasonography, the incidence of embryonic loss in beef cows from d 25 to 45 of gestation was 6.5%, whereas, a 4.2% incidence of embryonic loss was detected in beef heifers where ultrasonography was performed at d 30 of gestation and subsequently palpated rectally between d 60 and 90 after insemination. Ultrasonography was successful in identifying twins in induced twinning studies in which it was determined that cows induced to develop twins (67%) had more (P<0.05) fetuses as a percentage of all treated cows than those inseminated artificially (48%) or receiving an embryo (32%). In addition, the point of greatest embryonic loss occurs from d 33 to 69 in cows pregnant with multiple fetuses. Fetal sexing is fast becoming a common management tool in beef cattle enterprises with accuracy in sex determination exceeding 97%. The applications of ultrasound used by scientists include the ability to monitor follicular characteristics, to monitor ovarian function, and the ability to aid in follicular aspirations and oocyte retrieval. In the future, as technology improves, technicians will have an opportunity to use the internet or video conferencing for ultrasound image analyses. With every new technological development, scientists, veterinarians, and producers discover new possibilities for the use of reproductive ultrasound to enhance the scientific merit of research or improve reproductive efficiency in livestock.", "year": 2003, "openAccessPdf": null, "authors": [{"authorId": "144916109", "name": "G.

Each cow has been characterized by a maximum rate arrived at by averaging morning and evening observations on 2 days. Only this maximum rate has been studied. Repeatability was high (0\u00b78\u20130\u00b79) whether measured from day to day or from lactation to lactation. Maximum rate of flow was 10\u201316% higher in second than in first lactations. The range extended from under 2 lb/min to over 7 lb/min. Lactation yield of milk varied significantly with rate, rising about 50 gal for an increase of 1 lb/min. This relation is reduced or eliminated by taking into account by partial regression analysis either maximum weekly yield or the increase from the second to the peak week of lactation. Although the higher yielding cows had larger udder areas bounded by the four teats, the regression of 305-day milk yield on rate was not changed much by taking udder area into account. Cows with short teats milked faster and had higher yields than cows with longer teats. Differences in yield among the four quarters widened slightly between 1 and 3 months of lactation regardless of rate of flow, except possibly in the three slowest milking cows. In these the differences increased three times as much as in the other cows. The wider the inter-quarter differences in yield the less the proportion of milk obtained at the maximum rate. Heritability of maximum rate of flow derived from observations on paired singleborn cattle and twins was 85%. Field data would probably yield a value of 60\u201370%. Appropriate selection of breeding stock would effectively alter rate of flow, but there is no reason yet to expect yield of milk to change except perhaps by reducing the incidence of very slow milking cows.", "year": 1960, "openAccessPdf": null, "authors": [{"authorId": "49652998", "name": "H.

The explanation of the phenomenon is, briefly stated, that the male, during its development, produces certain substances (hormones) presumably in definite cells of the germ gland, and that these substances are transmitted to the zygotically female twin by way of the blood stream. The hormone is produced by the male much earlier than its liomologue in the female (Bascom, \u201923) and is of such potency that it modifies the opposite sex in the male direction.

However, Stoddart and Smith (1955) considered an animal unit (AU) as 1,000 lb of live weight. An animal unit was considered by the ASRM Range Term Glossary Committee (1964) to be one mature cow with calf or their equivalent. Shultis and Strong (1955) based the AUM on the amount of feed needed by one mature head of cattle two years old or older, or its equivalent, for good growth and production during one month. They further indicated that a beef cow with calf by side could be considered an AU but suggested greater precision by making an extra allowance for the calf. Neely (1963) proposed alternative bases for an AU depending upon the stage of production. For classes of beef cattle where body maintenance is the goal, he suggested a mature pregnant cow weighing 1,000 lb. Where gain in body weight is an important factor he suggested an 800-lb steer gaining 1.5 lb/day be used as the basis of the animal unit. Lactation has been shown to increase forage consumption over pregnancy or maintenance under free choice grazing. In a recent study on Utah summer range, Cook et al. (1961) found that lactating ewes weighing an average of 120 lb consumed 26% more dry matter than dry ewes, not considering forage eaten by the lambs. In studies with identical twins stall fed on fresh pasture herbage cut daily, Hutton (1963) found that lactating cows during a g-month lactation consumed 47% more gross energy than non-lactating cows. Lactating cows increased consumption 50% from calving to a peak at 150 days. In a Nevada study reported by Fleming et al. (1960)) green forage was cut and fed free choice to various classes of sheep. Ewes with single lambs, ewes with twin lambs, early weaned lambs, and yearling ewes consumed 200, 260, 91, and 98% as much forage respectively on a dry weight basis as dry ewes. The feeding tables of the National Research Council (1963) are based on a daily consumption of 18 lb dry matter by cows in gestation and 28 lb by lactating cows. This is a 55% increase in consumption. Although dry matter consumption by range cattle needs intensive study, a 25% increase in dry matter consumption resulting from appetite stimulation associated with lactation appears to be a conservative estimate where ample supplies of forage are available. Boykin et al. (1962) reported a cow and calf require about 40% more forage than a mature cow and slightly more forage than two yearlings. Suckling beef calves at an average age of 4 to 7 months of age were found in Virginia by Hammes et al. (1959) to consume about 7 lb of forage (air dry) per day. This is approximately 1/3 of the average dry matter consumption attributed to a dry, mature cow. The TDN equivalence of an AUM as used by technicians has been variable. Sampson ( 1952) suggested an AUM be further defined as 300 lb of TDN or the equivalent of 0.3 ton of hay. However, Shultis and Strong (1955) considered that 400 lb of TDN or about 800 lb of hay was equivalent to one AUM. Harris (1962) concluded an animal unit day should be considered 32,000 kcal. of apparently digestible energy, equivalent to 16 lb of TDN per day. These differences in TDN conversion to AUM\u2019s relate primarily to variable definitions of an AU. Shultis and Strong (1955) after Morrison (1949) based their conversion on an average requirement of 13.2 lb of TDN daily for cows nursing part of the year. Harris (1962) based his proposed conversion on the requirement of one cow in thrifty condition weighing 1,000 lb and producing 25 lb of milk testing 4% fat. Others have used the energy requirements of a mature beef cow in gestation (Sampson, 1952).", "year": 1999, "openAccessPdf": null, "authors": []}

It was the first protein of maternal origin to be described for a single ovulating species, namely cattle. JY-1 -like sequences corresponding to 3\u2019 coding and the untranslated region have been reported in other vertebrate species. This is the first description of the partial JY-1 (exon 3 and 3\u2019UTR) in a livestock species other than cattle and buffalo. The sequence was characterized in a panel of nine Indian goat breeds, which differ in reproductive traits (twinning percentage and age of sexual maturity). Forty three variations were recorded in the analysed region of goats JY-1 compared with cattle. Nucleotide variations in the codifying region of goats correspond to seven amino acid changes that could affect the biological function of the protein and possibly reproductive differences between goats (higher proportion of multiparous animals) and cattle (mainly uniparous). A novel single nucleotide polymorphism (C15329T) has been identified in Indian goats, which was genotyped in 272 animals from six breeds. Further studies to investigate other regions of the gene and its expression in goat female reproductive tissues would clarify the role of JY-1 in farm animal species that are not primarily uniparous.

Variation in age at eruption increased from 1st to 4th incisors, but the coefficient of variation remained constant at about 8%. The mean interval between eruption and complete emergence was about 5 weeks for the first three pairs of teeth and nearly 10 weeks for the 4th pair. 2. Variation in age at eruption within MZ pairs was no greater than that between left and right sides of the same animal. DZ displayed greater within-pair variances than MZ twins, and HZ pairs greater than DZ. 3. Correlations of age at eruption of teeth with body weight and with gain in weight were negative but non-significant.

Emphasis is on the results of New Zealand research on nutrition and management. Stocking rate, cow quality, liveweight\u2019 or condition at calving, level of feeding in early lactation, and nutritive value of pasture are considered to be important, but not grazing management during lactation. Limited evidence indicates that, in most instances, supplementary feeding during lactation is not economic.

I N T R O D U C T I O N THIS paper briefly discusses major factors influencing dairy production from pasture. A comprehensive review is not attempted in that emphasis is directed towards nutritional factors. The results of New Zealand research ate supplemented where necessary with those from other countries. POTENTIAL LEVELS OF PRODUCTION Estimates of the conversion on an annual basis of pasture dry matter (DM) are 25 kg DM/kg milkfat for twin cattle (Hutton,] 1971b) and 21 kg DM/kg fat for high genetic stock (Campbell, 1977) . Using an intermediate figure of 23 kg DM/kg milkfat indicates that, for highly productive land in the Waikato giving harvested yields of 15 t DM/ha/yr, attainable milk yields are the equivalent of 650 kg milkfat or about 1 800 kg milk solids for each grazed hectare. In Westland, where annual pasture yields of 10 t DM/ha are more appropriate, the potential is equivalent to 430 kg milkfat/ha, reducing to about 360 kg where all replacement stock are carried on the farm, Most importantly, yields of milk solids close to the probable potentia1 set by pasture production are being achieved on some research and commercial farms (Hutton, 1978; Campbell et al., 1977; Fowler, 1977; Davis et al., 1979).", "year": 2000, "openAccessPdf": null, "authors": [{"authorId": "50051936", "name": "A.

Most cases of retained placenta occurred during the fall. Forty-five percent of that seasonal increase was explained by an increased number of calvings. Metritis complex was diagnosed following 54.8% of retained placenta cases. Retained placenta alone did not significantly impair reproductive performance. Metritis complex, in the presence or absence of retained placenta, caused a significant (p\u22640.05) increase in days open, services per conception, calving to first heat intervals and days from calving to first service. There is an indication (interaction p\u22640.1) that cows with both retained placenta and metritis complex are more severely affected than cows with either retained placenta or metritis complex alone.

The objective was to evaluate whether bilateral (double) embryo transfers (ET) can improve pregnancy rate compared to ipsilateral (single) transfers. Bovine cumulus-oocyte complexes collected from slaughterhouse ovaries were matured for 20\u201322\u2009h, and subsequently subjected to a standard Brackett and Oliphant in vitro fertilization (IVF). Six hours after IVF, embryos denuded of cumulus were cultured in defined CR1 medium supplemented with essential and non-essential amino acids (CR1aa), plus 6\u2009mg\u2009mL\u22121 BSA for 2 days at 39\u00b0C under 5% CO2, 5% O2 and 90% N2, and then cultured in CR1aa medium supplemented with 7.5% FBS for a further 5 days on bovine cumulus monolayers. Expanded blastocysts with tighter compaction of the inner cell mass (quality 1) were selected on Day 7 for cryopreservation via modified solid surface vitrification (Dinnyes et al., 2000 Biol. Reprod. 513\u20138). Vitrification solution contained HEPES-buffered TCM199 supplemented with 20% FBS, ethylene glycol and dimethylsulphoxide. A droplet of 1\u20132\u2009\u03bcL vitrification solution containing 4\u20135 blastocysts was dropped directly onto a cooled surface within 30\u2009s after 3-min incubation in equilibration solution. Prior to ET, embryos were warmed and subsequently washed several times in 0.25\u2009M sucrose rehydration solution and M199\u2009+\u20097.5% FBS medium. The warmed embryos from initial trials were cultured for 2 to 72\u2009h to evaluate their viability after vitrification. During ET trails, vitrified embryos were loaded into transfer straws (one embryo per straw) after warming. The treatments were as following, (1) single transfers, one embryo was transferred into the horn ipslateral to CL; (2) double transfers, one embryo was transferred by non-surgical means into each uterine horn of a synchronous recipient on Day 7. ET trails were conducted in both the USA (double transfers) and China (single v. double transfers). Pregnancy was determined by palpation per rectum around Day 70 after transfer. The data were compared by Student\u2019s t-test. The survival rate of vitrified IVF embryos reached as high as 91.4% (n\u2009=\u2009256) 2\u2009h post-warming, and hatching rate was 70.7% (n\u2009=\u2009154) 72\u2009h after culture in vitro, respectively. The data (Table 1) show that double transfers resulted in a significantly higher pregnancy rate than did single transfers (P\u2009<\u20090.05). With double transfers, a higher pregnancy rate was achieved in the USA than in China (76.2% v. 45.6%, P\u2009=\u20090.079). This study confirms that double embryo transfers can improve the pregnancy outcome after ET, perhaps because bilateral placement of embryos may increase embryonic signals to the maternal environment. Further evaluation of gestation length, single/twin conception and calving difficulty is under investigation.

All effects significantly affected both weight and gain traits except for dam's age that was significant for BW, W120, YW and ADG3, and age at weighing that was significant for W120, WW, YW, ADG2, ADG3, ADG4. Estimated least squares means of growth traits were compared using Scheffe's multiple-range tests. Highest BW (40.57 kg) and W120 (172.43 kg) were found for BA calves. BS calves had highest WW (260.30 kg), YW (424.07 kg), ADG1 (1 154 g), ADG2 (1 053 g), ADG3 (1 054 g) and ADG4 (1 098 g). Highest BW, YW, ADG3 and ADG4 were found for males-singles. Males-twins had highest W120, WW, ADG1 and ADG2. Calves descending from 5-7 years old dams had highest BW, W120, WW, ADG1, ADG2 and ADG4. The proportion of variability of growth traits explained by HYS effect (42.96-71.69%) was high, whereas proportions of variability explained by SEX effect (2.03-5.77%), age of dam (1.02-2.24%) and breed (1.05-2.21%) were low. Residuals accounted for 23.71 up to 53.79% of total variance.", "year": 2018, "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://www.agriculturejournals.cz/publicFiles/52511.pdf", "status": "GOLD"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "37109047", "name": "E.

In the course of a 2-year field trial (1959\u201360) conducted in mid-Wales, 525 cattle were entered by 317 co-operating farmers for treatment with p.m.s. in the induction of multiple-pregnancy. Most animals were commercial, non-pedigree cattle maintained in accord with local custom. The cattle were of mixed ages and included some milking cows as well as animals used in calf rearing. 2. The method of hormone treatment tested consists of a single subcutaneous injection of a freeze-dried preparation of p.m.s. administered in the follicular phase of the oestrous cycle. Most cows were injected 16 or 17 days after a previous oestrus and bred by a.i. at the heat period following injection. 3. Of the 525 cattle injected 416 provide comprehensive data on factors affecting ovulatory response; seventy cattle, which had a \u2018silent heat\u2019 after injection, provide additional but partial information. In thirty-nine cattle, it was not possible to obtain reliable evidence of response. Data on ovulation and pregnancy were obtained by examinations per rectum conducted during the early weeks of pregnancy. 4. Ovulation data relate to 416 cows which were injected, came in oestrus shortly afterwards and inseminated, then examined for evidence of fresh corporea lutea at the following mid-cycle stage. Five dosage levels of p.m.s. were employed (800, 1000, 1200, 1600 and 2000 i.u.). The normal process of ovulation did not appear adversely affected by any of the doses employed. 173 of the 416 cows (41\u00b76%) produced more than one egg. 5. There is clear evidence of a dose-response relationship over the dosage range employed. The mean number of ovulations varies from 1\u00b743 at 800 i.u. to 3\u00b797 at 2000 i.u. The percentage of cattle shedding additional eggs rises from 33 at 800 i.u. to 56\u20136 at 2,000 i.u., but increasing dosage level leads to considerable variability in ovulatory response: range of ovulations at 800 i.u. is 1\u20135, and at 2000 i.u. is 1\u201325. 6. Little affect was observed in ovulatory response according to the stage of p.m.s. administration. At low dosage levels, an interval of at least 2 days between injection and oestrus was necessary to allow response to occur. Among factors affecting response to a standard dose of p.m.s., lactation and state of normal ovarian activity appeared to have some importance. There was no evidence of an effect on cycle length. Treatment did not give rise to abnormal mating behaviour and the incidence of adverse side-effects following p.m.s. injection was negligible. The occurrence of large unovulated follicles occurred more frequently following treatment with 2000 i.u. than with lesser dosage levels. 59\u00b71% of all ovulations occurred in the right ovary and 40\u00b79% in the left. In examinations made prior to injection, the incidence of spontaneous double ovulations was 4\u00b71%. 7. With the p.m.s. approach, it is found that one problem in cattle is that of silent heat, the condition where ovulation is not accompanied by the usual symptoms of oestrus. In 486 animals for which information was obtained, silent heat occurred in 70 (14\u00b74%). There is some tendency for the condition to occur more frequently where low dosage levels are used or where p.m.s. is administered very late in the oestrous cycle. Lactation appears to affect the incidence of the defect. The lowest incidence (4\u00b78%) occurs in \u2018dry\u2019 cows and the highest (22\u00b77%) in cattle rearing three to four calves. Superovulation occurred less frequently at silent heat than at normal oestrus. There is no evidence that p.m.s. injection is the direct cause of the condition. It appears that time of ovulation in animals showing silent heat is comparable with that for cattle showing the normal symptoms. 8. Of the 416 cattle put to a.i. shortly after p.m.s. administration, 317 (76\u00b72%) were pregnant when examined some 6 weeks after first insemination. This compares closely with the normal 30\u201360 day non-return figure for the mid-Wales area (78\u00b75%). Cattle conceived as readily after injection with 2000 i.u. as after treatment with 800 i.u. Even where animals shed many eggs (e.g. more than six) the conception percentage (84\u00b70) was high. It is clear that this form of therapy does not adversely affect the processes of ovulation, fertilization and implantation. There is some suggestion that p.m.s. aided conception in repeat-breeder cattle. Examinations in the mid-cycle stage following a.i. did not adversely affect conception. 9. Data on the number of eggs surviving (as foetuses) in the 6th week after mating, in relation to the initial number of ovulations, clearly show a heavy loss in eggs in early pregnancy. 41\u00b76% of cattle shed additional eggs but only 23\u00b71% possessed multiples in early pregnancy. 10. Reduction to a single foetus seemed particularly liable to occur in cattle producing two eggs-only. Of sixty-seven double-ovulating animals that conceived, thirty-two possessed twins at the 6th week (47\u00b77%). The survival of both eggs in such cows was better when one egg was shed by each ovary (61\u00b75%) than where both ovulations occurred in the one ovary (28\u00b76%). Analysis of data on egg survival according to factors such as age, breed, time of treatment did not reveal differences. 11. Trans-uterine migration of eggs was rarely (1 case in 197 examinations) noted. The ability of a single uterine horn to sustain more than two foetuses was limited. In cattle where three to six eggs were shed by an ovary, the survival of twins in the associated uterine horn was observed in a majority (57%) of cases. Where many eggs (ten to fifteen) were shed by an ovary, twins were rarely sustained by the associated uterine horn. 12. A steady increase in the percentage of cows carrying multiples (at 6 weeks) was noted over the dosage range employed. 20\u00b78% of cows injected with 800 i.u. carried multiples, the figures for doses of 1000, 1200 1600, and 2000 i.u. being 25\u00b72, 31\u00b73, 41\u00b77 and 42\u00b77, respectively. Multiples in the form of triplets and quadruplets occurred more frequently at the higher dosage levels than at 800\u20131000 i.u. of all cows with multiples considered, 36\u00b75% possessed more than two foetuses at examination in the 6th week. 13. Pregnancy diagnosis examinations were conducted over a period ranging from 35 to 101 days after mating, with most falling in the period 41\u201344 days. It appeared that the most appropriate time for diagnosing multiples was at the end of the 6th week of pregnancy. The need to conduct diagnosis at a specific time after mating, and the fact that the examination may lead to total litter loss in many animals, makes the procedure unsuitable for any widespread practice. Partial litter loss (loss of one foetus) was observed in 12\u00b75% of cows carrying twins at 6 weeks and in 20\u00b70% of those with triplets. 14. In nineteen cows, each possessing either three or four foetuses, an attempt was made in the 6th week of pregnancy to control litter size to two. This was by rupture of excess amniotic vesicles by manipulation per rectum. Two of those so treated eventually produced calves, the others either aborting or returning in oestrus soon after the control procedure. The method is unsuitable for farm application for reason of the delay in returning to normal breeding after such cases of failure of pregnancy. 15. A substantial proportion (32\u00b75%) of those cows which were subjected to pregnancy diagnosis lost the conceptus a short time afterwards. Foetal loss in cows with twins was greater (43\u201346%) where foetuses were both in the one horn than where distributed between both horns (31%). The various factors which were possibly involved in foetal loss are discussed. Evidence was obtained that total foetal loss occurred more frequently in animals shedding many eggs than in those shedding few. 16. Information is recorded for 147 injected cattle which produced single calves following conception at the oestrus immediately following hormone treatment. Additional data on single calvings are provided by 200 untreated cattle which were studied in the area of the trial. These data show birth weight of single calves to be 78\u00b76 lb., and the incidence of calf mortality, retention of foetal membranes and difficult calvings to be 4\u00b79, and 6\u00b70%, respectively. The mean duration of the gestation period was 283\u00b74 days. 17. The outcome of multiple calving was observed in forty-four cattle (thirty-five sets of twins, eight sets of triplets and one set of quintuplets). As a result of earlier examinations, farmers were usually alert to the fact that cows were carrying twins. Herd owners were encouraged to provide such cows with an additional 2 cwt. of a suitable concentrate feed during the final 2 months of pregnancy. Although a number of herd owners followed the recommended feeding programme, in a number of instances the most appropriate pre-calving preparation was not given. The outcome of calvings in relation to the level of additional feeding is considered under three headings, high, moderate and low plane. 18. Given good feeding (high plane) the outcome of twin calvings was satisfactory. Results suggest that the problems often associated with twins (low-weight calves, high rate of mortality, retained foetal membranes, loss of conditon and poor subsequent breeding of the dam) may largely be overcome by an adequate \u2018steaming-up\u2019 policy. In cows adequately prepared, birth weight ranging from 59 to 89 lb. were recorded (mean 73\u00b79 lb.) Mean gestation was a little less (280\u00b76 days) than for singles. The incidence of retained foetal membranes (18\u00b72%) was greater than that for single-bearing cows, but did not constitute a serious problem in any animal. 19. Less satisfactory results were noted in cows not given adequate preparation for twins. Where triplets were carried, the outcome for cow and calves, regardless of the feeding attention given, was unsatisfactory. Triplet-bearing cows calved earlier, and the incidence of retained foetal membranes, difficult calvings and calf deaths was much above that noted for the twin", "year": 1962, "openAccessPdf": null, "authors": [{"authorId": "2064837817", "name": "I.

The overall twinning rate was 3.01%. Mean incidence of twins increased from first to fourth and later parities: 1.10, 3.20, 4.22, and 4.50%, respectively. For first-parity cows, a maximum frequency of twinning was observed from January through April (1.36%), and second- and third-parity cows showed peaks from July to September (at 3.35 and 4.55%, respectively). The phenotypic rate of twinning decreased from 1991 to 2007 for the first, second, and third parities. Sire predicted transmitting abilities were estimated using linear sire model and threshold sire model analyses. Sire transmitting abilities for twinning rate in the first, second, and third parities ranged from -0.30 to 0.42, -0.32 to 0.31, and -0.27 to 0.30, respectively.

Heritability estimates for twinning rate, obtained from the analysis of threshold models, were greater than the estimates of linear models. Solutions for age at calving for the first, second, and third parities demonstrated that cows older at calving were more likely to have twins.

Abstract Twinning in Holstein dairy cows has increased over time concurrent with increased milk production. Twinning in dairy cattle is not desirable due to the negative effects on both cows that calve twins and calves born as twins that result in economic losses to dairy farms.

Most twinning in dairy cows is dizygotic and directly related to the incidence of double ovulations, and economic losses are greater for unilateral than for bilateral twins. Hormonal manipulation before artificial insemination that allows for timed artificial insemination is a primary strategy for decreasing twinning in dairy cows before it occurs by decreasing the incidence of double ovulation thereby decreasing conception of dizygotic twins and the associated negative economic consequences.

Twenty-one cows in the prostaglandin (PG) F2\u03b1-induced follicular phase were assigned to receive either 100 ml of estradiol antiserum produced in a castrated male goat (n = 11, immunized group) or the same amount of castrated male goat serum (n = 10, control group). The time of injection of the sera was designated as 0 h and Day 0. Five cows in each group were assigned to subgroups in which we determined the effects of estradiol immunization on LH secretion and follicular growth during the periovulatory period. The remaining six estradiol-immunized cows were subjected to long-term analyses of follicular growth and hormonal profiles, including evaluation of pulsatile secretion of LH. The remaining five control cows were used to determine pulsatile secretion of LH on Day 0 (follicular phase) and Day 14 (midluteal phase). The control cows exhibited a preovulatory LH surge within 48 h after injection of the control serum, followed by ovulation of the dominant follicle that had developed during the PGF2\u03b1-induced follicular phase. In contrast, the LH surge was not detected after treatment with estradiol antiserum. None of the 11 estradiol-immunized cows had ovulation of the dominant follicle, which had emerged before estradiol immunization and enlarged to more than 20 mm in diameter by Day 10. Long-term observation of the six immunized cows revealed that five had multiple follicular waves, with maximum follicular sizes of 20\u201345 mm at 10- to 30-day intervals for more than 50 days. The sixth cow experienced twin ovulations of the initial persistent follicles on Day 18. The LH pulse frequency in the five immunized cows that showed the long-term turnover of cystic follicles ranged from 0.81 \u00b1 0.13 to 0.97 \u00b1 0.09 pulses/h during the experiment, significantly (P < 0.05) higher than that in the midluteal phase of the control cows (0.23 \u00b1 0.07). The mean LH concentration in the immunized cows was also generally higher than that in the luteal phase of the control cows. However, the LH pulse and mean concentration of LH after immunization were similar to those in the follicular phase of the control cows. Plasma concentrations of total inhibin increased (P < 0.01) concomitant with the emergence of cystic follicles and remained high during the growth of cystic follicles, whereas FSH concentrations were inversely correlated with total inhibin concentrations. In conclusion, neutralization of endogenous estradiol resulted in suppression of the preovulatory LH surge but a normal range of basal LH secretion, and this circumstance led to an anovulatory situation similar to that observed with naturally occurring follicular cysts. These findings provide evidence that lack of LH surge because of dysfunction in the positive-feedback regulation of LH secretion by estradiol can be the initial factor inducing formation of follicular cysts.", "year": 2002, "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://academic.oup.com/biolreprod/article-pdf/67/6/1840/10558592/biolreprod1840.pdf", "status": "BRONZE"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "34885200", "name": "H.

The freemartin phenotype appears in a dizygotic twin pregnancy where one twin is a male and the other is a female. Due to precocious anastomoses between the placental vascular systems of the two fetuses, masculinising molecules reach the female twin and disrupt the normal sexual differentiation, whilst in the male the effects of this association are usually minimal. In cattle, this condition is observed in 90 to 97% of twin pregnancies. A freemartin is, by definition, a genetically female fetus masculinised in the presence of a male co-twin, giving rise to a sterile heifer. Genital tract defects with varying severity can be observed in freemartin animals, which often present suppression and disorganization of the ovary, originating a rudimentary or a testis-like gonad depleted of germ cells. The uterine horns may be hypoplastic or instead may be reduced to a cord-like structure suspended in the broad ligament. Anatomic continuity between the uterus and the vagina is frequently absent, and the existence of rudimentary vesicular glands is typical. The external genitalia commonly presents enlarged clitoris, small vulva and a prominent, male-like tuft of hair. As a rule, heifers born twin to a bull have to be considered sterile and should be identified as early as possible to cull them from replacement stock. Despite its limitations, freemartinism is currently diagnosed by physical examination, as karyotyping or blood typing is often considered an unnecessary expense. In cattle, twinning trend has a genetic background that has been associated to hormonal regulation in favor of double ovulations. However, the genetic determinant on the basis of twinning seems to have small importance when compared to environmental or managementassociated factors, particularly in dairy cows. In fact, in dairy animals, in particular in high milk producing cows, it has long been proven the increase of twin calvings due to the hormonal and metabolic disturbances in the energy balance early in the post-partum period. * E-mail address: rtpayan@gmail.com Alexandra Esteves, Ren\u00e9e B\u00e5ge and Rita Payan-Carreira, R With increased incidence of twin births in cow it is reasonably expectable a small increase in the occurrence of freemartins at the farm levels.

Its application in agricultural breeding can significantly speed up genetic gain rates by reducing generational intervals, increasing selection intensity, and facilitating the dissemination of valuable genetics. IVP is an increasingly important tool for breeding companies given the ongoing emphasis on feeding a growing population with fewer resources. With the above in mind, the aim of this work was to improve the yield of competent, euploid, and high genetic merit IVP embryos available for transfer. \n \nOocytes destined for IVP are commonly assessed for developmental competence by morphological screening. To determine whether it would be possible to improve the utilisation of oocytes per donor, the developmental competence of porcine oocytes with decreasing cumulus oocyte complex (COC) investment was examined. It was found that current IVP practice is wasteful, through the elimination of oocytes with slightly impaired morphology, which still have remarkable developmental potentials. \n \nMoreover, whilst it is accepted that embryo splitting (generating more than one embryo from a single fertilized zygote) could benefit the breeding industry by increasing the offspring of the most desirable parents, a comparative analysis of the different splitting methodologies available, including stage of the split and single versus serial splitting strategies, is currently missing in the literature. Here, the splitting of an 8-cell stage embryo into four identical twins was identified as the strategy producing the greatest output of good quality embryos. Additionally, time-lapse investigation of the embryo splits found evidence of the existence of a developmental clock that tightly regulates early cleavage events. \n \nNormally, only embryos that display satisfactory morphology are selected for transfer. However, in cattle and pigs, this assessment is complicated by the accumulation of lipid droplets within the embryo, which renders it opaque. Consequently, there is scope for the application of new imaging modalities, such as optical coherence tomography (OCT), which are able to image an embryo in full depth and non-invasively. In this work, swept source OCT was successfully tested for use in early stage bovine embryos to obtain both structural and functional imaging. Moreover, micron-scale movements were measured within blastocysts by OCT as a way to rapidly discriminate between living and deceased embryos, representing a novel application of this methodology. \n \nEmbryo biopsies can be used to establish the genetic merit of an embryo through single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) analysis, allowing the application of genomic selection soon after fertilisation rather than at birth. Moreover, SNP information can be analysed by karyomapping to select the most chromosomally normal embryos for transfer. Here, the birth of the first five karyomapped calves in the world is reported. Additionally, karyomapping was used to measure the incidence of aneuploidy in bovine blastocysts by parent of origin and to determine the recombination frequency for each chromosome, demonstrating the applicability of this methodology to basic research.", "year": 2017, "openAccessPdf": null, "authors": [{"authorId": "134035205", "name": "G.

There have been multiple reasons hypothesized to explain this but the most influential one has been found to be double ovulation due to lowered levels of progesterone. Metabolism by the liver leading to decreased progesterone levels at time of ovulation leads to an increase in circulating luteinizing hormone, and therefore the occurrence of codominance and increased likelihood of a double ovulation event occurring. Twining has many negative health risks associated with it and there are three current methods that aim to either maintain higher levels of progesterone during ovulation or function to eliminate one twin while still in its developmental stage.

In cattle, female carriers of Robertsonian and X-autosome translocations tend to be repeat breeders, probably due to synaptic difficulties during meiotic prophase of gametogenesis. Although viable offspring have been obtained through somatic cell nuclear transfer (NT) using adult or fetal cells from normal animals in various species, there have been no reports to date on the application of this technology to translocation carriers. Since NT circumvents meiotic problems encountered by translocation carriers, we used this approach to generate cloned embryos, fetuses and calves from a subfertile Limousin-Jersey crossbred cow previously identified as a carrier of an X-autosome translocation. Primary cultures were established from ear skin biopsies, and used at the 5th or 6th passage for NT. Recipient oocytes were enucleated at 19\u2009h post-maturation (hpm), fused with individual fibroblasts by a single electrical pulse (1.4\u2009KV\u2009cm\u22121, 40\u2009\u03bcs) and activated at 24\u2009hpm with a combination of ionomycin (5\u2009\u03bcM, 5\u2009min) and cycloheximide (10\u2009\u03bcg\u2009mL\u22121). Reconstructed eggs were cultured in SOF at 39\u00b0C in a humidified low oxygen atmosphere. In 33 runs involving 2470 oocyte-donor cell complexes, cleavage and blastocyst rates were 88% (2173/2470) and 36% (889/2470), respectively. Two or three blastocysts (Day 7\u2009\u00b1\u20091) were transferred into each recipient, previously synchronized with a combination of CIDR, GnRH and PGF2\u03b1. Ultrasonography was performed at Days 28 to 60 and at Days 90 and 150. Pregnancy was confirmed on Day 28 in 10 of a total of 22 recipients, 2 of which were later found to be carrying twin fetuses. Of 60 embryos transferred, 11 (18.3% of embryos) survived to Day 42, 6 (10%) to Day 60, and 4 (6.6%) to Day 90. A Day-94 fetus was surgically retrieved to examine the synaptic pattern of meiocytes in fetal ovaries. The fetus and internal organs were normal in appearance, and of normal size (16.5\u2009cm C-R length). The X-autosome translocation was confirmed in blood cultures, and synaptic anomalies involving chromosome 23 and the X chromosome were detected in fetal ovaries. Another clone was delivered by C-section at 276 days but died within 1\u2009h of delivery, while one singleton pregnancy is still ongoing at >200 days. These results demonstrate that NT can be used to produce embryos, fetuses and offspring from an X-autosome translocation carrier, with the potential to facilitate study of synaptic behaviour of female germ cells, and X-inactivation in different cell lineages of cloned blastocysts, and to generate individuals with otherwise poor reproductive prospects.

Cows from 4 freestall dairy herds [2 in New York (NY) and 2 in Wisconsin] were enrolled at 266 d carried calf. Precalving data included body condition score, locomotion score, and blood nonesterified fatty acids (NEFA) concentration; calving-associated data included previous days carried calf, calving ease, calf sex, twins, stillbirth, and parity. Cows were each tested 6 times for hyperketonemia from 3 to 16 DIM on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays using the Precision Xtra meter (Abbott Laboratories, Abbott Park, IL). Hyperketonemia was defined as a blood BHBA concentration of \u22651.2 mmol/L. Multivariable fixed-effects Poisson regression models were developed to predict the probability of a cow developing hyperketonemia between either 3 and 16 DIM or at her first BHBA test. As only the NY herds had precalving NEFA data, each prediction model was developed twice: once with data from all 4 herds (n=1,672) and once with data from only the NY herds (n=544). For the models with data from all 4 herds, increased body condition score group and an interaction between advanced parity and herd were important predictors of hyperketonemia development at any time from 3 to 16 DIM; calf sex (male), herd, and an advanced parity by increased body condition score group interaction were important predictors of hyperketonemia development between 3 and 5 DIM. The 4-herd models had a 64 and 78% predictive concordance for hyperketonemia between 3 and 16 DIM and at first BHBA test, respectively. For the models with data from the NY herds only, increased NEFA, calf sex (male), advanced parity, and herd were found to be important predictors of hyperketonemia development at any time from 3 to 16 DIM; increased NEFA, calf sex (male), decreased calving ease, stillbirth, and advanced parity were important predictors of having hyperketonemia at first BHBA test.

The aim of the experiment was the comparison of Central European breeds and to investigate genotype \u00d7 rearing system interaction both within and between breeds. Veal calves were slaughtered at about 120 to 150 kg live weight (proportionately about 0\u00b713 of estimated mature weight of bulls) and yearling bulls at 410 to 460 kg live weight, corresponding to proportionately 0\u00b738 of estimated mature weight. In general, the dual-purpose breeds had higher growth rates both absolute (AGR) and relative (RGR) and better food conversion ratios (FCR) than the dairy breed, Friesian, and this was true irrespective of whether correlations were made to constant age, weight, maturity (equal proportion of adult weight) or carcass fatness. However, the early-weaned Friesian calves grew fastest in the early phase of the growing period and this probably reflected their superior appetite. Interactions between breeds and rearing system (bull v. veal) were significant for RGR and for maturity-corrected FCR which was mainly caused by shifting of the positions of BV and Pi. The pooled genetic correlations between performance in the different fattening categories were considerably below unity. The twin-pair correlations indicated high heritabilities which are biased by contributions from dominance and maternal environment. While in data corrected to comparable maturity, AGR and RGR were highly positively correlated, their correlation became negative in agecorrected data. The correlations with FCR displayed an equivalent change with sign reversed. The correlations between wither height and heart girth with AGR were positive for age-corrected data but negative or barely positive, respectively, for data corrected to equal maturity. Again, FCR behaved similarly but with sign reversed.", "year": 1986, "openAccessPdf": null, "authors": [{"authorId": "1657678322", "name": "H. Khalil"}, {"authorId": "4564104", "name": "F.

The increasing use of nitrogen fertilizers to sustain increasing number of cows has increased the risk of enhanced nitrate leaching and methane and nitrous oxide emissions. In this study, Compromise Programming (CP) and Weighted Goal Programming (WGP) have been applied to a Waikato dairy farm to reconcile economic goals with environmental and resources management goals. The models are based on Tier 2 methodology, developed specifically for New Zealand, for determining the energy requirements of cattle.

The results further shows that by keeping the number of cows calving in autumn within 150\u2013200, and by putting an optimum area under the maize crop, it is possible to meet the twin objectives of minimizing the nitrogen leaching and maximizing the profit margins, though the production target has to be lowered significantly.", "year": 2015, "openAccessPdf": null, "authors": [{"authorId": "153915923", "name": "R.

The Tat pathway contributes to the virulence of numerous bacterial pathogens that cause disease in humans, cattle and poultry. Thus, the Tat pathway has the potential to be a novel therapeutic target. Deciphering the Tat protein transport mechanism has been challenging since the active translocon only assembles transiently in the presence of substrate and a proton motive force. To identify inhibitors of Tat transport that could be used as biochemical tools and possibly as drug development leads, we developed a high throughput screen (HTS) to assay the effects of compounds in chemical libraries against protein export by the Escherichia coli Tat pathway. The primary screen is a live cell assay based on a fluorescent Tat substrate that becomes degraded in the cytoplasm when Tat transport is inhibited. Consequently, low fluorescence in the presence of a putative Tat inhibitor was scored as a hit. Two diverse chemical libraries were screened, yielding average Z'-factors of 0.74 and 0.44, and hit rates of ~0.5% and 0.04%, respectively. Hits were evaluated by a series of secondary screens. Electric field gradient (\u0394\u03c8) measurements were particularly important since the bacterial Tat transport requires a \u0394\u03c8. Seven low IC50 hits were eliminated by \u0394\u03c8 assays, suggesting ionophore activity. As \u0394\u03c8 collapse is generally toxic to animal cells and efficient membrane permeability is generally favored during the selection of library compounds, these results suggest that secondary screening of hits against electrochemical effects should be done early during hit validation. Though none of the short-listed compounds inhibited Tat transport directly, the screening and follow-up assays developed provide a roadmap to pursue Tat transport inhibitors.", "year": 2016, "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/file?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0149659&type=printable", "status": "GOLD"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "4725435", "name": "U.

In general, twinning can be a good approach to increase reproductive capacity, and consequently the production volume. Cattle are monovular animal, typically give birth to one offspring and multiple birth is rare. Multiple gestation is mostly unfavorable in the dairy industry due to their negative impact on reproductive and production performance on cow and calf. Twinning is highly correlated to ovulation rate and various genes that are affecting hyperprolificacy in sheep have been identified. Many studies have reported quantitative trait loci (QTL) that are associated with high ovulation rate and twinning in cattle.

The purpose of these estimations was to rank input of nitrogen by source, determine the amount of total nitrogen potentially available to both ground and surface water through leaching and runoff, and identify areas in the basin where excess nitrogen is produced. The results of the input estimations suggest that domestic septic systems account for less than 1 percent of the total nitrogen input in the basin and precipitation accounts for 6 percent. The remaining 93 percent is produced by cattle manure (29 percent), fertilizer (45 percent), and legume crops (19 percent). Input from cattle manure, fertilizer, and legume crops varies widely among counties and reflects differences in landuse practices such as different cropping patterns and numbers of dairies and feedlots. Residual total nitrogen was estimated by subtracting loss due to cattle manure storage and application, crop uptake, and decomposition of previous-year nonleguminous crop residue (chaff) from all nitrogen input in the basin. Positive mean values of residual total nitrogen in most counties suggest that more total nitrogen is input than is lost. This residual total nitrogen is available for runoff to surface water or leaching to ground water. Three out of four counties where mean values of residual total nitrogen were highest (Cassia, Gooding, and Twin Falls) are located in the western part of the basin, where eutrophication in the Snake River is evident and ground water from many wells contains anomalously high nitrate concentrations. Ground water in the fourth county (Bingham), which includes the Fort Hall area north of Pocatello, also contains high nitrate concentrations. A mass balance of total nitrogen input and loss in Gooding, Jerome, Lincoln, and Twin Falls Counties suggests that more than 6,000,000 kg (6,600 tons) of total nitrogen is input in this four-county area than is discharged by the Snake River. This excess nitrogen probably is utilized by aquatic vegetation in the Snake River (causing eutrophication), stored as nitrogen in soil, stored as nitrate in the ground water and eventually discharged through the springs, utilized by noncrop vegetation, and lost through denitrification.", "year": 1996, "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://pubs.usgs.gov/wri/1996/4008/report.pdf", "status": "BRONZE"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "37385717", "name": "M.

The mean productive lifespan of primiparous and secundiparous dairy cows delivering twins is about 300 and 200 days shorter, respectively, than that of cows delivering singletons. In addition, the long-term negative effects of twinning are not limited to the early lactation but continue for a period of up to 800 days after calving. Herd management options after diagnosing a twin pregnancy are discussed from an animal health and economic perspective. Abstract Multiple ovulations and so multiple pregnancies have increased recently in dairy cattle. The incidence of the double ovulation impact in high producers at insemination may be over 20%. Twin pregnancies are undesirable as they seriously compromise the welfare and productive lifespan of the cow and herd economy. Clinical problems extend from the time of pregnancy diagnosis to pregnancy loss, abortion or parturition. Early pregnancy loss or abortion of multiple pregnancies lead in most cases to culling. In cows reaching their term, mean productive lifespan is up to about 300 days shorter for cows delivering twins than for cows delivering singletons. While there is an urgent need to address multiple pregnancy prevention procedures in the foreseeable future, the incidence of twin pregnancies continues to rise in parallel with increased milk production. Herein, we review two contrasting measures proposed for the time of twin pregnancy diagnosis: (1) gonadotropin-releasing hormone treatment for pregnancy maintenance, or (2) embryo reduction. These options are discussed in terms of their implications for individual animal health and herd economy. Our main conclusions find that manual twin reduction has proven to be the best management option, whereas the use of prostaglandin F2\u03b1 for inducing abortion may be a better option than doing nothing.", "year": 2020, "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://www.mdpi.com/2076-2615/10/11/2006/pdf?version=1604128687", "status": "GOLD"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "1398071649", "name": "F.

A stock of animals selected in the past for high performance in some trait cannot be expected to do uniformly well in all environments in which it can be maintained. It is reasonable to assume further that, in some cases at least, optimum performance can only be obtaincci by selecting distinct strains under the conditions in which they are to be reared. The objectives of the present investigation were to determine the degree to which genotype-environment interactions were of importance in one case of economic interest, and to see if it were possible to indicate, from the outcome of this and other tests previously reported, under what general conditions genotype-environment interactions would be expected to be of practical significance. When previous results were considered it was found that genotype-environment interactions varied in their importance in different situations. BONNIER and HANSON (1948), studying the lactation of identical twin cattle reared with two intensities of feeding, concluded on indirect evidence that the genotypeenvironment interaction was likely to be very large. A study by MORLEY (1956) of the performance of half-sib groups of Australian Merino sheep, separated and reared on high and low planes of nutrition, showed that genotype-environment interactions were unimportant for fleece characteristics, but significant for body weight. KING and YOUNG (1955), comparing three different breeds of sheep overwintered in warm or cold environments and on high or low planes of nutrition, concluded that no interactions occurred either in the case of fleece characteristics or growth rate.

Sixty-five years ago, the phenomenon of placental fusion in cattle gave rise to a study of the inheritance of red blood cell types in bovine twins by Dr. Ray Owen2 at the University of Wisconsin. In his groundbreaking study, Dr. Owen found that dizygotic cattle twins almost invariably shared a mixed blood type.2 The modern fields of immunogenetics and immunologic tolerance thus were born.3 In a review of the subject published in 1957,4 Dr. Owen summarized his analysis of 100 pairs of cattle twins and some with higher multiple births, showing that the proportions of red cell types in the twin pairs varied mainly from 50:50 to 40:60, with a few pairs showing somewhat more divergent ratios. To quote the review, \u201cIn cases in which one cell type was predominant, the same cell type was generally found to be predominant in both twins, a clear indication that the foreign cells were not at a selective disadvantage.\u201d In the case of the twin\u2013twin transfusion syndrome treated with laser surgery reported by Assaf et al1 the asymmetric distribution of chimerism (28% male, 72% female) was thought to be the result of the transfusion donor twin being the female with the male twin being the transfusion recipient before surgical intervention and laser ablation of vascular anastomoses. Importantly, as in the case of the cattle twins the ratios were similar in both offspring, indicating that the rules for mixed chimerism do not appear to vary between cattle and humans. The report by Assaf et al1 in the current issue of this journal is paralleled by a similar report of twin\u2013twin transfusion by Bogdanova et al.5 The difference in the latter study, however, is that blood chimerism was 100% male, even in the female twin who was demonstrably XX in her buccal mucosa. Thus, it may be said that, in cases of unequal distribution of blood flow due to fetal\u2013fetal transfusion, chimerism can deviate significantly from a 50:50 ratio. However, in the end the final relative amount of male and female twin blood distribution mostly likely reflects the stem-cell populations that have been implanted equally in each twin. As in vitro fertilization and direct in utero transplantation of zygotes continues to increase in developed countries, it may be expected that dizygotic twin\u2013twin transfusion syndrome may occur more frequently. More reports of this phenomenon will establish beyond any doubt that in humans, as in dizygotic cattle twins, immunologic tolerance is readily achieved by in utero fetal\u2013fetal transfusion, and that this tolerance persists into adult life. A number of very interesting immunologic questions are raised by these \u201cexperiments of nature,\u201d and follow-up studies of such twins as adults could yield important clues as to mechanisms of successful tolerance induction to organ and tissue transplants.

The normal separation of fetal membranes consists of complex hormonal process that starts before parturition in cows, which normally drops within shortly after birth. If the placenta is not expelled within certain time (12 h post calving and 3 h post foaling), it is defined as being retained placenta (RP). RP is a condition where all or part of the placenta or membranes are left behind in the uterus during the third stage of labour. Retained placenta results in a number of problems following pulling. The increase in the number of microorganisms in the uterus causes inflammation, decreased milk yield, reduce conception rate and inturn elongtes calving interval and reduces fertility. RP causes great economic losses, mainly due to decreased milk yield and loss due to infertility. The number of risk factors of retained placenta include stillbirth, dystocia, abortion, twin, fetotomy, induction of parturition, cesarean section, shortened gestation, managemental system, heridetary, hormonal, infectious disease and maternal immune system. Since there are many causative agents of retained placenta, the treatments which are commonly used for the retention of fetal membranes do not show any significant effects. Basically, we have to avoid the occurrence of dystocia through genetic selection of dam and sire having minimal probability for RP, proper prepartum nutritional status and exercise. Special care should be paid for nutrition and vitamine supplementation, especially during the dry period. The aim of this review was to spot the light on retention of fetal membranes in dairy cattle and to disseminate relevant information for the predisposing factors and the preventive measures that ay decreases its incidence and keeps fertility. It could be concluded that RP is an important problem which causes great economic losses and leave the animal subfertile even after treatment and recovery.

This causes the newborn lambs to be at risk of death due to starvation, mismothering, cold exposure and infection. Niacin has previously been demonstrated in cattle to increase immunoglobulin concentrations in colostrum, possibly due to niacin increasing blood flow, allowing the greater accumulation of nutrients and immunoglobulins in colostrum. High producing animals, such as the late gestation twin-bearing ewe, may not be able to produce enough niacin to meet their production requirements. Aims This experiment evaluated whether supplementation of niacin (vitamin B3) to late gestation twin-bearing ewes would increase colostrum production and composition (concentration of fat, lactose, protein and immunoglobulin G), and postnatal lamb growth.

A study to see the effects of concentration of Follicle Stimulating Hormone (Folltropin) on the ovulation rates and twinning birth was conducted. The experiment designed was commpletely randomized designed with 3 treatment of total concentration of FSH (A: 12, B: 6 and C 3 ml) and 4 lactating cows for a replications. Hormon was intramussculary injected in decreasing dossis method twice a day with 12 hours apart for 4 days. Data recorded were the diameter of ovary (DO), total corpus luteum (TCL), concentration of progesterone on the day 12 of estrus cycle (P), percentage of pregnancy and number of birth. FSH significantly increased the ovulation rates. The means DO was significantly (P < 0.05) higher after injection (6.3 cm) than those before injection (2.0 cm). The TCL and P were highly significant (P < 0.01) higher after injection. The TCL and P were 1.2 and 0.8 ng/ml and 8.5 and 3.0 ng/ml before and after hormone treatment respectively. Concentration of FSH significantly increase (P < 0.05) the TCL and P but not for DO. The means DO, TCL and P were 5.0, 4.5 and 1.6, 5.5, 8,8 and 1.8 and 8.4cm, 12.3 and 5.3 ng/ml for treatments C, B and A respectively. Persentage of pregnancy was decreasing by the increasing of ovulations rates and the highest percentage of pregnancy 75% was obtained on treatments C. The normal single birth was found for treatment C and neonatal death were occurred for treatment B and A where the number of calves is higher than 2. In conclusion the FSH increased the ovulation rates in dairy cattle and the ovulation rates obtained was also affected by the concentration of hormone.

Experimental objectives were to 1) assess relationships among aromatase (CYP19A1), IGF-1 (IGF1), IGF-2 receptor (IGF2R), and FSH receptor (FSHR) mRNA expression in small (\u22645 mm) antral follicles and 2) determine their association with increased numbers of developing follicles in ovaries of Twinner females. Ovaries were collected from mature, cyclic (d 3 to 6) Twinner (n = 11), and Control (n = 12) cows at slaughter and pieces of cortical tissue were fixed and embedded in paraffin. Expression of mRNA was evaluated by in situ hybridization using (35)S-UTP-labeled antisense and sense probes for CYP19A1, FSHR, IGF1, and IGF2R mRNA. Silver grain density was quantified within the granulosa and theca cells of individual follicles (2 to 7 follicles/cow) by Bioquant image analysis. Follicles of Twinners tended to be smaller in diameter than Controls (1.9 \u00b1 0.1 vs. 2.3 \u00b1 0.1 mm; P = 0.08), but thickness of granulosa layer did not differ (P > 0.1) by genotype. Relative abundance of CYP19A1 (P < 0.01) and FSHR (P < 0.05) mRNA was greater in granulosa cells of Twinners vs. Controls, respectively, whereas IGF2R mRNA expression was less in both granulosa (P < 0.01) and theca (P < 0.05) cells in follicles of Twinners vs. Controls, respectively. Abundance of CYP19A1 mRNA in granulosa cells was correlated negatively with IGF2R mRNA expression in both granulosa (r = -0.33; P < 0.01) and theca (r = -0.21; P = 0.05) cells. Expression of IGF1 mRNA was primarily in granulosa cells, including cumulus cells, and its expression did not differ between Twinners vs. Controls (P > 0.10). Detected increases in CYP19A1 and FSHR, but not IGF1, mRNA expression along with decreases in IGF2R mRNA expression in individual follicles of Twinners support the hypothesis that increased follicular development and steroidogenesis in Twinner females result from increased extra-ovarian IGF-1 production.

Two sets of fistulated identical-twin dry cows were maintained on the same feed and feeding schedule, t Ia l f of the cows involved in each feeding trial were administered poloxalene twice daily at 0.044 g per kg of body weight. Milk samples were collected during evening milkings. Pooled milk from cows fed silage, hay, and grain in the University dairy herd served as a control to milk from cows fed bromegrass and rye pasture. Milk from two cows maintained on hay and grain served as a control to milk from alfalfa-fed cows. Flavor scores of milk samples from poloxalene-treated, untreated, and control cows were compared. Poloxalene had no important effect on milk flavor. Poloxalene reduced surface tension and pH of rumen fluid of fistulated cows. A single dose of poloxalene effectively maintained reduced rumen surface tension 24 to 36 hr. Some investigators have suggested that flavor compounds are transmitted from the rumen and lungs into blood and then into milk (2, 4). I f so, excessive gas pressure in the tureen might increase undesirable flavor in milk. Rumen gas pressure is altered by bloat. Fermentation gases, trapped in rumen digesta during bloat, form a stable foam that probably inhibits eructation (1). Dougherty et al. (2) reported that eructed gases may enter the lungs and thus transmit flavor compounds to milk. Antifoaming agents used to prevent bloat liberate trapped gases from frothy digesta, which might make them available for absorption from the lungs and rumen. However, if gas fails to become trapped, earlier elimination of rumen gases might improve milk flavors. Shipe (8) Received for publication August 23, 1966. ~Contribution no. 643, Department of Dairy and Poultry Science, Kansas Agricultural Experiment Station, Manhattan. 2Supported in part by a grant from Smith Kline and French Laboratories, Philadelphla, Pennsylvania. reported that the lungs act not only as points of absorption but also as points of elimination. In studies of the effect of surface-active agents on bloat, no evidence of any foreign flavor in the milk or cream was observed when cows were treated with relatively low doses of linseed oil, soybean oil, mixed beef and mutton tallow or peanut oil (6). Whale oil affected milk flavor and was considered unsuitable as bloat treatment (5). The effectiveness of poloxalene as a bloatpreventive agent has been demonstrated (1). Treatment levels of 5 to 20 g poloxalene administered once or twice daily prevented legume bloat nearly 100% of the time for at least 12 hr in cattle fed green alfalfa. Two producers, cooperating in a field study, found that poloxalene made extended daily grazing periods possible and felt that it may have reduced the incidence of pasture flavors in milk. Helmer et al. (3) reported that poloxalene had no adverse effect on milk production, feed intake, animal health, reproduction, or rumen fermentation. However, this paper is the first report of a controlled experiment concernblg the effect of potoxalene on milk flavor. The flavor of milk from both bloating and nonbloating cattle fed a bloat-provoking feed was investigated. Experimental Procedure Animals and feeding. Lactating cOWS were pastured on bromegrass (Trial I ) , rye pasture (Trial I I ) , or on bloat-provoking, freshly cut alfalfa (Trial I I I ) . Half of the cows involved in each trial were treated with poloxalene; half were not treated. Two pairs of rumen-fistulated, identical-twin, dry cows were mantained on the same feed and the same feeding schedule as the lactating cows, to simulate the physical conditions of tureen fluid. All cows involved in each feeding trial were selected from the Kansas State University dairy herd and were average-to-good producers in mid-lactation. The number of cows in each of the three feeding trials, their feeding schedule, and treatment are presented in Table 1. In Trial I and II , the cows were milked at about 4 A~ and at 2:30 P~. They were fed only small quantities of grain mixture at milking time, to maintain their appetites for roughage.

In group I (n=22) Swiss breed animals were selected, in group II (n=13) - black-and-white cows, in group III (n=15) - crossbred cattle. All animals selected for the experiment were previously subjected to hormonal stimulation in order to synchronize the sexual cycles. The synchronization scheme included the injection of GnRh analogues at a dose of 10 ml IM and PgF2a cloprostenol at a dose of 500 mg per animal. With the manifestation of symptoms of estrus, all animals were arti-ficially inseminated with the sexed semen of a Belgian blue bull. On the seventh day of the sexual cycle, all inseminated animals had the procedure of replanting a frozen-thawed embryo into the contralateral uterine horn relative to the corpus lu-teum diagnosed on the ovary. To avoid freemartinism of heifers, the recipients were implanted with sexed embryos which were previously obtained from donor cows of the Hereford breed.

Neurologic disturbances usually begin between 1 and 2 years old but have been seen as early as 6 months. There is progressive incoordination. Inability to rise develops over a period of months; urinating in an uneven flow is an early abnormality in females [3]. Vision, alertness, appetite and appendicular muscle tone and mass remain normal. In sections stained with hematoxylin and eosin (HE), myelinated parts of the optic nerves, brain and spinal cord have ill-defined foci of fine filaments separated by a pale-pink ground substance (fig. 1, 2). The foci or plaques tend to be more numerous in specific anatomic areas [l]. Normal axons are within these foci of disordered myelin (fig. 3). Oligodendroglia adjacent to the plaques may be hypertrophied with a round vesicular nucleus, dense peripheral chromatin and granular cytoplasm, which gives them an epithelioid appearance (fig. 2). Ultrastructurally , the lesion of the myelin sheath is adjacent to nodes of Ranvier and consists of hypertrophied and hyperplastic oligodendrocytic projections from which arise many small processes. There also are incomplete myelin lamellae and paranodal myelin figures [l]. These changes reflect a defect of unknown cause in oligodendroglia. Progressive ataxia has been seen in twin purebred Charolais heifers born in Oklahoma. Twin 1 at 6 months had posterior incoordination; by 8 months this had progressed to walking with a stilted gait and legs spread apart. At rest the rear legs were held forward. At 1 year old she could not rise on her hind legs without assistance. She was killed and necropsied. Peculiarities in urination were not recorded. No gross lesions were seen at necropsy except a torn round ligament and subluxation of the right femoral head. At 8 months twin 2 had posterior incoordination. She died when she was 2 years old. During the last weeks she could rise only with assistance; bloat had to be relieved several times. Two weeks before she died she had a heifer calf which remains unaffected at the age of 8 months.

The distribution of retained placenta was compared between the two dairy herds by means of Chi-square test and then analyzed by means of logistic regression of linear models. The following factors in the first lactation were not significant (P>0.05) or not associated with retained fetal membrane: stillbirth, twins, calving difficulty, previous abortion, milk fever. Twins were not significantly associated to retained fetal membrane (P>0.05) in the second lactation. Stillbirth, twins, calving difficulty, previous abortion and milk fever (P<0.01) in second lactation were significantly associated to retained fetal membrane. Univariate analysis showed that there was a significant correlation between risk factors for retained placenta. The variables for stillbirth and milk fever were associated with retained fetal membrane. The combined effect of calving season and previous abortion for retained fetal membrane was examined and the results displayed that cattle calved during hot months and had a history of previous abortion were 22 times higher possibility to experience retained placenta, by comparison of cows that calved in non-hot months and without a history of previous abortion.

Bonnier\u2019s equation: m = 2npq-n2/2pq(n-n2), estimates the proportion of MZ among SST (m) based on total opposite-sexed twin (OST) pairs (n2) and the observed proportions of male (p) and female (q = 1-p) calves among all twin births. Bonnier\u2019s equation assumes the sex of one twin is independent of the other, therefore, similar proportions of SST and OST would be expected in the absence of MZ. We hypothesized a dramatic decrease in Bonnier\u2019s estimate of MZ if SST comprised a smaller proportion of a population than reported. Based on our study, 56.4% of twin calves were SST, and 51.9% were male. The estimates of MZ were calculated by simulating a reduction of SST of 5% (54.2% SST) or 10% (52.0% SST), whereas the proportion of male calves born as twins was 51.9% (observed) or simulated to be 50% (Table 1). Estimates of MZ were greater than expected based on observed outcomes of MZ (Silva del R\u00edo et al., Therio. 66:1292; 2006). We conclude that slight changes in the percentage of SST dramatically affect MZ estimates using Bonnier\u2019s equation, whereas the percentage of male calves born as twins has a minimal impact. Thus, if factors other than MZ affect the proportion of SST, such as oocyte maturity, vaginal and uterine pH, or hormonal estrous synchronization, then Bonnier\u2019s equation will inaccurately estimate the frequency of MZ.", "year": 2008, "openAccessPdf": null, "authors": [{"authorId": "90840889", "name": "N.

Traditionally, breeders have used visual appraisal to estimate cows\u2019 genetic merit. By carefully recording the characteristics of herd members and their descendants, animal breeders can calculate an animal\u2019s expected progeny difference, or EPD. This is a figure estimating the average performance of specific traits for an individual\u2019s offspring. More recently, geneticists have developed DNA tests associated with important traits in cattle. These tests may some day be incorporated into the established selection process. According to ARS geneticist R. Mark Thallman, incorporating DNA tests in breeders\u2019 calculations could improve the accuracy of their EPDs and place the appropriate degree of emphasis on the DNA tests. With geneticist Mark F. Allan, he is testing that theory, using a herd selected to produce twins as a prototypical population. Previous research had located three genetic regions linked to the twinning trait. This information has been incorporated into the scientists\u2019 calculations since 1998, enabling them to make more accurate genetic predictions, or \u2018marker-adjusted EPDs\u2019. The twinning experiment is simply one example of markerassisted selection\u2019s potential. In similar work, researchers from Cornell University, ARS and Iowa State University incorporated DNA test results into a genetic evaluation of Simmental cattle for tenderness, allowing Simmental breeders to use marker-assisted selection for tenderness. In the future the technique could be used to improve other desirable traits, such as efficiency, fertility and growth rate. Marker-assisted selection will allow breeders to increase the speed and accuracy of traditional assessment methods, but its advantages extend beyond the seedstock industry. Commercial cattle producers would be able to purchase bulls with superior genetics. The desirable characteristics in the livestock would ultimately translate into better products for consumers.", "year": 2006, "openAccessPdf": null, "authors": [{"authorId": "48787772", "name": "D.

Perinatal mortality was defined as cases of stillborn calves or calves having died within 24 h after birth. From a representative sample of 53 herds (breeds: Holstein Friesian and crossbreedings between Holstein Friesian and Blackpied Dairy Cow), dairy herd improvement (DHI) records were obtained providing information about number of calvings, frequency of PM, parity, calving ease, gender, twin calvings and herd milk yield. Management practices (farm organisation, breeding policies, calving management, hygienic measures, feeding, status of infectious diseases) were recorded using a questionnaire filled in whilst interviewing the herd owner. Data of one year from 46 herds with 13 158 calvings were analysed using logistic regression models applying generalised estimation equations (GEE). The overall frequency of PM was 9.3%. The odds ratio for PM was 5.89, 1.73, 1.68 and 1.67 in cases of dystocia, heifer calving, twin and male calves, respectively. None of the management factors examined in this study remained as significant effects for PM in the final logistic regression model. In conclusion, the results of this study suggest that cow/calf related factors reported as risk factors for PM in many studies in the past such as dystocia, number of lactation, gender and twins were also major determinants of PM in commercial dairy herds in Thuringia. Besides applying appropriate breeding policies herd owners should primarily consider ways of further improving calving management with proper calving supervision and correct calving assistance in order to reduce the risk of PM.", "year": 2010, "openAccessPdf": null, "authors": [{"authorId": "3910517", "name": "M.

This faces us with the double problem of the amounts of active hormones that may be transferred from one animal to its parabiotic twin and of the threshold values of the hormones considered. Witschi 1 states that the capillary connections in chains of a newt let pass enough of the hypophyseal hormones to stimulate the processes leading to metamorphosis, but too little to bring about the expansion of the melanophores. From this it becomes obvious that the quantitative factor should be taken into consideration at the outset of parabiosis experiments. The author, therefore, has started some colorimetric studies on the amount and speed of exchange of blood in parabiotic rats. The technique developed by Dawson, Evans and Whipple 2 and by Smith 3 in their work on the blood volume of dogs has been adapted to the special conditions of our experiment.

However, some dairy herds have reported a deficiency of colostrum production, which ranges from a low volume to no colostrum produced, by cows during fall and winter. Little information regarding this phenomenon exists. The purpose of this study was to characterize the syndrome and identify potential risk factors for low colostrum yield. A 2,500-cow Jersey dairy farm was enrolled in a prospective cohort study in May 2016, to evaluate possible effects of photoperiod, temperature, and cow factors on colostrum production. Dairy personnel were trained to collect, weigh, and evaluate colostrum quality. Information on parity, previous lactation length, previous 305-d mature-equivalent milk production, and dry period length were collected through the farm's dairy management software. Weather and photoperiod data were also collected. Over the year of enrollment, 2,988 eligible cows calved and had colostrum weights recorded and 38% were primiparous (n = 1,143), 25% were in their second lactation (n = 752), and 37% were in their third or greater lactation (n = 1,093). The overall average colostrum yield was 6.6 kg/cow in June 2016, 2.5 kg/cow in December 2016, and 4.8 kg/cow in May 2017. Multiparous cows had a larger decline in colostrum production between June and December (6.6 to 1.3 kg/cow) compared with primiparous animals (6.5 to 4.2 kg/cow). Overall, average colostrum production decreased by 0.17 kg/cow per week during this time, 0.22 kg for multiparous cows and 0.08 kg for primiparous cows. A logistic regression model was constructed for all cows to evaluate effects of cow factors on low colostrum production (<2.7 kg at first milking). Dry period length, calf sex, singleton or twin, age at freshening, month of calving and previous lactation length were significantly associated with the probability of low colostrum yield (<2.7 kg at first milking). A cross-correlation function analysis between the time series for colostrum yield and photoperiod revealed a high correlation at the time of calving and 1 mo prior, particularly for multiparous cows. A pedigree analysis showed that extreme colostrum yield (low vs. high) followed some sire lines. Low colostrum production in this herd could have an economic effect on the dairy and calf health and appears to have a strong seasonal and, potentially, a genetic component.", "year": 2018, "openAccessPdf": {"url": "http://www.journalofdairyscience.org/article/S0022030218302960/pdf", "status": "HYBRID"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "107855500", "name": "K.

The protocols consisted of a progesterone intravaginal device fitted for five days, along with the administration of different combinations of gonadotropin releasing hormone, equine chorionic gonadotropin and a single or double dose (24 h apart) of prostaglandin F2\u03b1. In Experiment I, the data were derived from 232 lactating cows. Binary logistic regression identified no effects of treatment on ovulation failure or multiple ovulation 10 days post artificial insemination (AI). Based on the odds ratio, the likelihood of ovulation failure was lower (by a factor of 0.1) in cows showing at least one corpus luteum (CL) upon treatment than in cows lacking a CL; repeat breeders (> 3 AI) and cows with multiple CLs at treatment showed lower (by a factor of 0.44) and higher (by a factor of 9.0) risks of multiple ovulation, respectively, than the remaining animals. In Experiment II, the data were derived from 5173 AIs. The independent variable treatment failed to affect the conception rate 28\u201334 days post AI, twin pregnancy or early fetal loss 58\u201364 days post AI. The results of this study demonstrate the efficacy of 5-day progesterone-based protocols for FTAI. All four protocols examined were able to induce ovulation in both cyclic and non-cyclic animals so that FTAI returned a similar pregnancy rate to spontaneous estrus. Our results suggest that the ovarian response and fertility resulting from each treatment are due more to the effect of ovarian structures at treatment than to the different combinations of hormones investigated.", "year": 2014, "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/jrd/60/6/60_2014-063/_pdf", "status": "GOLD"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "1398071668", "name": "I.

In the juvenile cases (n=11), malignant lymphoma and sarcoma were the commonest forms. In comparing tumour patterns in calves with those reported in adult cattle, it was apparent that tumours were less common in the former (6 versus 60 per 100000) and that, with the exception of malignant lymphoma, the types of tumour differed. Carcinomas, which were virtually absent in calves, predominated in adults, probably due to the longer exposure of older animals to carcinogenic factors. In comparing tumour patterns in calves with those reported in pigs and children, it was clear that calf cases were mainly sporadic, with the notable exception of malignant lymphoma in twins. In young pigs, however, several types of tumour (some hereditary) were reported on a single farm as multiple cases. In children, tumours occurred more frequently than in calves, and many neoplasms in both children and calves could be regarded as embryonic tumours or hamartomas.

The heifers were 132 +/- 13 d pregnant at the time of measurement. The pairs were fed at 1.15 x maintenance energy requirements for a minimum of 30 d prior to heat production (HP) measurements in dual indirect respiration calorimetry chambers. The diet fed was cracked corn:alfalfa hay (45:55) with a determined ME of 2.47 +/- .02 Mcal/kg DM. This diet was fed individually for 7 d prior to and during two consecutive 22-h HP measurements. The animals then were fasted for 2 d and fasting heat production measurements (FHP) were made on d 3 and 4 of the fast. Metabolizable energy required for MEm was calculated iteratively by assuming a semi-log relationship between HP and metabolizable energy intake. There were no differences (P greater than .10) in measured energy expenditures due to different breed type. The FHP and efficiency of ME use for MEm (Km) were similar between sexes, although heifers had lower (P less than .025) MEm than steers. Twin pair effects were detected for FHP (P less than .005) and MEm (P less than .05) but not for Km. Broad sense heritability estimates were calculated as the intraclass correlation between members of monozygous twin pairs. Heritability estimates for MEm, FHP, and Km were .52 +/- .22, .75 +/- .13, and .34 +/- .27, respectively.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", "year": 1991, "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://academic.oup.com/jas/article-pdf/69/3/940/22649201/940.pdf", "status": "BRONZE"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2253321901", "name": "S K Hotovy"}, {"authorId": "2256588852", "name": "K A Johnson"}, {"authorId": "2253038722", "name": "D E Johnson"}, {"authorId": "2251999205", "name": "G.

Although the number of twins has consistently increased, triplet and quadruplet pregnancies represent 0.015 and 0.004% of the total births, respectively. Multiple births are the result of multiple ovulation and/or the spontaneous cleavage of one fertilized oocyte, which is known as monozygotic (MZ) twinning. In cattle, approximately 5 to 14% of all twin births are MZ, and births with more than two MZ calves are extremely rare. Monozygotic animals are genetically identical, and those derived from two or more zygotes are genetically different. Furthermore, the presence of placental vascular anastomosis can result in fetal chimerism. Notwithstanding, animals born as single calves can be chimeras when one of the fetal twins dies undetected in utero. Here we used DNA testing to study the zygotic condition of an unusual female quadruplet born from a Braford cow bred in a multi-sire natural mating system without hormone stimulation. Two tissues with different embryological origin were sampled to test zygosity and possible chimerism. The results showed an identical genotype, confirming they all originated in an MZ pregnancy and suggesting the lack of chimerism in all animals. The use of MZ twins in breeding and selection systems provides an alternative to the conventional progeny testing. Some works have suggested a genetic background of MZ twins in humans.

Cows giving twins had shorter (p < 0.0001) gestation and more (p < 0.005) days to first heat, first service and days open than cows giving singles. Incidence of dystocia was higher in cows with twins (22.5%) than those with singletons (7.22%). Survival rate of singles was 12.9% greater than that of twins at birth, whereas perinatal mortality rate was 16.25 % (9.37% stillborn & 6.88% dead after birth) for twins and 3.33% (2.06% stillborn & 1.27% dead after birth) for singles. Culling rate was greater in cows producing twins (61.53%) than those with singles (30.73%). Twinning in cattle shortens the length of gestation, impairs subsequent reproductive performance by prolonging postpartum breeding intervals, increases the incidence of dystocia and perinatal calf mortality and increases number of cows to be culled during subsequent lactation. Thus, twinning in dairy cattle is undesirable due to its detrimental effect on cow fertility and health and calf survival. However, these adverse effects can be minimized by preparturient diagnosis of twin pregnancy and timely administration of obstetrical assistance which aids in management of dystocia to facilitate delivery of twin calves and to increase their neonatal survival.", "year": 2009, "openAccessPdf": null, "authors": [{"authorId": "153877326", "name": "A.

Twin combinations were 1) two pairs of Belgian Blue fetuses that were designated as HM (HM), 2) two pairs of Holstein fetuses that were designated as LM (LM), and 3) four pairs of mixed fetuses; the four Holstein fetuses were designated as LM (HM) and the four Belgian Blue fetuses were designated as HM (LM).

Our aims were to identify parentage SNPs with exceptional qualities for use in globally diverse breeds and to develop a subset for use in North American sheep. Starting with genotypes from 2,915 sheep and 74 breed groups provided by the International Sheep Genomics Consortium (ISGC), we analyzed 47,693 autosomal SNPs by multiple criteria and selected 163 with desirable properties for parentage testing. On average, each of the 163 SNPs was highly informative (MAF $ 0.3) in 48 6 5 breed groups. Nearby polymorphisms that could otherwise confound genetic testing were identified by whole genome and Sanger sequencing of 166 sheep from 54 breed groups. A genetic test with 109 of the 163 parentage SNPs was developed for matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization\u2013 time-of-flight mass spectrometry. The scoring rates and accuracies for these 109 SNPs were greater than 99% in a panel of North American sheep.

Genetic progress and improvements in nutrition and management practices have led to a continuous increase in milk yield and thus also to multiple ovulations and twin pregnancies. Twin pregnancies are undesirable as they seriously compromise the welfare of the cow and herd economy. A better understanding of the processes associated with multiple ovulations should help to reduce rates of twinning. During the stages of the sexual cycle, temperature gradients are established within the ovary and throughout the genital tract. Pre-ovulatory local cooling of the reproductive system favors male and female gamete maturation and subsequent fertilization. In fact, thermal mechanisms may prevent or favor multiple ovulations and thus twinning. The purpose of this review was to update this topic. Abstract While cows are predominantly monovular, over the past 30 years the incidence of multiple ovulations and thus twinning has increased considerably alongside milk production. Multiple pregnancies are not desirable as they negatively affect the health of cows and the herd economy. Although causal mechanisms associated with multiple ovulations have been extensively revised, the process of multiple ovulations is not well understood. Recent studies on the thermal biology of the reproductive system have shown how thermal mechanisms may prevent or favor multiple ovulations. This review focuses on this relationship between thermal dynamics and multiple pregnancies. Cooling of the pre-ovulatory follicle is able to regulate ovulation. In effect, pre-ovulatory local cooling of the female reproductive system favors male and female gamete maturation and promotes fertilization. Thermal stress is proposed here as a model of stress. Periods of high ambient temperature affect the processes of pre-ovulatory follicular cooling and multiple ovulations. While the ratio between unilateral and bilateral multiple pregnancies is normally close to one, under heat stress conditions, this ratio may be 1.4 favoring unilateral multiple pregnancies. A ratio approaching unity is here proposed as an indicator of cow wellbeing.", "year": 2021, "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://www.mdpi.com/2076-2615/11/2/435/pdf?version=1612765945", "status": "GOLD"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "3898790", "name": "F.

These errors are common to all types of balance trial, and the most important respect in which mineral balances differ from those of nitrogen, carbon and energy is in the absence of gaseous products, which means that both collection and analysis are simpler. I shall assume that the trial has been made with all the refinements of technique required, and confine this paper to the examination of the results. For some 40 years, since Mitchell developed his method for estimating biological value, the balance trial has been shown to give satisfactory practical comparisons of the nutritive values of foods, such as sources of protein or of calcium. Difficulties arise only when the balance trial is used to measure absolute instead of relative values, when we assume that positive balance is identical with accretion of an element in the body, for which the term retention will be used, and negative balance with depletion. Unlike the assumption that analyses are accurate, which can be tested statistically, this one is not easy to test. It has to be examined by considering the changes in the body of the animal represented by the loss or gain of the amounts of material indicated by the balance results. That can be done only if we possess enough information on variations in body composition of the type of animal being studied. The production of laboratory animals of inbred strains and also in recent years the breeding of very uniform strains of commercial poultry has made available stocks of small animals of high uniformity. With such genetically homogeneous animals it is possible to select at the start of an experiment two groups so well matched that the mean composition of the carcasses of one group represents with measurable probability the mean of the living cohort group also. Comparison of the composition of the first group at the start of the experiment with that of the second group at the end is equivalent, within calculable limits, to measuring the changes which have occurred in the second group. Hence when cohort analyses are combined with balance studies of the same animals they provide an excellent check on the accuracy of the balances. But of course this applies only to uniform populations, and two difficulties arise in the study of large livestock or man. The first is that the accuracy of the carcass analysis begins to decline as a result of the increased difference in magnitude between size of sample and bulk of carcass, leading to magnification of analytical error. T h e second, and more serious, is that genetically inhomogeneous populations such as ordinary farm animals or men are too variable to provide cohort groups, though variation in some farm animals may be reduced by the use of identical twins. In addition, slaughter experiments are expensive with large animals, which probably explains the paucity of information on the carcass composition of cattle, and are impossible with men. Usually it is necessary to rely on indirect methods of studying", "year": 2005, "openAccessPdf": null, "authors": [{"authorId": "2143997161", "name": "L."}]}

Artificial insemination was first successfully applied to cattle in the early 1900s. The next major developments involved semen extenders, invention of the electroejaculator, progeny testing, addition of antibiotics to semen during the 1930s and 1940s, and the major discovery of sperm cryopreservation with glycerol in 1949. The 1950s and 1960s were particularly productive with the development of protocols for the superovulation of cattle with both pregnant mare serum gonadotrophin/equine chorionic gonadotrophin and FSH, the first successful bovine embryo transfer, the discovery of sperm capacitation, the birth of rabbits after in vitro fertilization, and the development of insulated liquid nitrogen tanks. Improved semen extenders and the replacement of glass ampules with plastic semen straws followed. Some of the most noteworthy developments in the 1970s included the initial successes with in vitro culture of embryos, calves born after chromosomal sexing as embryos, embryo splitting resulting in the birth of twins, and development of computer-assisted semen analysis. The 1980s brought flow cytometric separation of X- and Y-bearing sperm, in vitro fertilization leading to the birth of live calves, clones produced by nuclear transfer from embryonic cells, and ovum pick-up via ultrasound-guided follicular aspiration. The 20th century ended with the birth of calves produced from AI with sexed semen, sheep and cattle clones produced by nuclear transfer from adult somatic cell nuclei, and the birth of transgenic cloned calves. The 21st century has seen the introduction of perhaps the most powerful biotechnology since the development of artificial insemination and cryopreservation. Quick, inexpensive genomic analysis via the use of single nucleotide polymorphism genotyping chips is revolutionizing the cattle breeding industry. Now, with the introduction of genome editing technology, the changes are becoming almost too rapid to fully digest.", "year": 2017, "openAccessPdf": {"url": "http://www.journalofdairyscience.org/article/S0022030217310366/pdf", "status": "HYBRID"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "48773884", "name": "S.

Incidence and cause(s) of the shorter gestation length and of the increased retained placenta and dystocia associated with twinning were evaluated for 3,370 single and 1,014 twin births produced in a population of cattle selected for natural twin births. Gestation length was shorter for twin than for single pregnancies (275.6 vs. 281.3 d, P<.01) and likely contributed to the higher incidence of retained placenta associated with twin births (27.9 vs. 1.9%; P<.01). Incidence of retained placenta was also higher in the spring (March-April) than in the fall (August-September) calving season (18.3 vs. 11.4%; P<.01). The higher incidence of dystocia with twins than with singles (46.9 vs. 20.6%, P<.01) was primarily due to abnormal presentation (37.0 vs. 4.5%, respectively) of one or both twin calves at parturition. First- (40.5%) and second- (22.7%) parity dams with a single birth had more (P<.01) dystocia than older dams (13.4%), whereas dystocia was not affected (P>.10) by parity with twin births. Because of the shorter gestation length and the increased incidence of retained placenta and(or) dystocia, achievement of increased productivity with twinning in cattle necessitates intensive management of twin-producing dams and their calves during the calving season.

Cattle were divided into a spring (70 d) and fall (60 d) breeding season and bred by a combination of AI and natural service. Ovulation rate, pregnancy status, and fetal number and distribution were determined by transrectal, real-time ultrasonography of the uterus and both ovaries at the end of the breeding season. Pregnancy was reconfirmed by rectal palpation at 75 to 135 d of gestation. For heifers and cows combined, ovulation rate increased (P < 0.01) from 1.46 +/- 0.4 in 1994 to 1.89 +/- 0.4 in 2004; number of calves per parturition increased (P < 0.01) from 1.34 +/- 0.3 to 1.56 +/- 0.3, respectively, which included an increase in triplet and quadruplet ovulations and triplet births. Bilateral twin ovulations yielded proportionately more (P < 0.01) twin births than unilateral twin ovulations. Ovulation rate was greater (P < 0.01) in the fall than spring breeding season. Pregnancy rate at ultrasound diagnosis did not differ among females with 1, 2, or 3 ovulations (89.1 +/- 0.7, 91.2 +/- 0.7, or 91.5 +/- 2.8%, respectively), but rates at calving decreased (P < 0.01) with increasing ovulation rate (85.1 +/- 0.6, 82.7 +/- 0.6, or 64.2 +/- 2.7%, respectively).

The majority of invitro-derived cattle embryos are transferred into recipient cows as recently collected (i.e. 'fresh') embryos due to the lack of a reliable cryopreservation method that results in favourable pregnancy rates following transfer of thawed embryos. This is a primary reason for the poor industry uptake of this extreme temperature freezing process. Numerous investigations into vitrification have revealed the importance of rapid cooling and warming rates, enhancing embryo viability after cryopreservation compared with conventional slow freezing. Those studies spawned a considerable assortment of cryovessels and diversity of procedures, delivering variable rates of success, which makes performing vitrification consistently a practical challenge. Hence, further research is required in order to both optimise and standardise vitrification methodology and to design a cryovessel that enables direct transfer of vitrified embryos to recipients after warming. In parallel with improvements in vitrification, it is important to continue to raise the quality of invitro-derived cattle embryos through modifications in laboratory culture techniques. The twin goals of methodology refinement and standardisation, leading to embryo quality enhancement, are each imperative if invitro fertilisation technology is to be adopted in the field.", "year": 2019, "openAccessPdf": null, "authors": [{"authorId": "38541490", "name": "V.

The area is almost wholly mountainous. On the eastern side is the crest of the Colorado range, including its culminating point, Pikes peak, and including also a part of the rather abrupt southern end of this range as it dies out en echelon. The central and western portions of the district form essentially a high plateau, penetrated on the south by the narrow valley which will hereafter be referred to as Garden park bay. The most prominent topographic feature of the region is the mass of Pikes peak, which rises to an elevation of 14,083 feet above sea level. On the east the descent of 8,000 feet to the plains takes place within eight miles, but is broken by many smaller mountain and foot-hill masses lying in the area of the Colorado Springs sheet. West of the peak the descent is rather abrupt to a general plateau between 8,500 and 10,000 feet altitude, which stretches westward for many miles, and is practically the level of the great South park. The relation of the Pikes peak elevation to this plateau is brought out by the profile section B-B, extending from Pikes peak to the Platte river canyon, shown on the structure section sheet of the folio. To the south the plateau is deeply scored by many canyons of comparatively recent erosion, which cut nearly to the level of the plains, at about 6,000 feet. The greatest elevation is that of Pikes peak, and the least that of Oil creek, as it crosses the southern boundary of the area at about 5,500 feet above sea level. Drainage. The drainage of the district is by tributaries of the South Platte and Arkansas rivers. In the northwestern corner the South Platte river issues from South park on the line of the map and cuts its way through the Eleven Mile canyon, _ curving in its course from, east to north. Almost the entire northern third of the district is drained into the Platte, either directly, by Twin creek, or through branches of Trout creek which passes north through Manitou park. In the northeastern corner of the map area is the head of Fountain creek, which courses south of east to its debouchure upon the plains at Manitou Springs, and thence finds its way southward to the Arkansas. The remaining two-thirds of the area is drained by direct tributaries of the Arkansas, the most important of which are Oil creek, Beaver creek and Currant creek. These are the streams which have cut the numerous deep canyons in the granite plateau. The Royal Gorge of the Arkansas approaches at its upper end to within one mile of the southern map line, south of West Eight Mile park. Culture. In spite of its proximity to the earliest settled portion of Colorado the district of the Pikes peak sheet had no important settlement until the mines of Cripple Creek were discovered. Along the line now followed by the Colorado Midland railroad ran the old stage line from Colorado Springs through South park to Leadville, and Florissant has long been a small village. The plateau region is arid but affords extensive grazing lands for cattle. In Garden park and at certain places in the upper valley of Oil creek, and in Currant creek, there are bottom lands which through irrigation yield good crops of hay, and on Beaver creek in the area of the sedimentary rocks is a small district where fruit is easily grown. The northern and western slopes of Pikes peak were at one time thickly covered with a luxuriant forest of spruce which many years ago was largely burned over and is now replaced by a dense growth of aspen. Over the general plateau country there is a struggling growth of spruce and of pifion pine, and in the lower ground of Garden park and along the base of the mountains pifion pine, cedar and scrub oak are quite uniformly but sparingly present. Various species of cactus and other plants of dry climates are found in the lower portions of the area.", "year": 2011, "openAccessPdf": null, "authors": []}

All cows came from herds served by artificial inseminations, 72 per cent being Swedish red-and-white (SRB), 25 per cent Swedish Friesian (SLB) and 3 per cent other breeds. \n \n \n \nThe incidence of retained placenta was higher after twin births and when the calves were stillborn. The sex distribution of the calves was normal. A positive correlation existed between retentio secundinarum and parturient paresis. On the other hand the incidence of ketosis did not increase after retentio secundinarum. \n \n \n \nAmong pure-bred cows the incidence of retentio secundinarum was 4.8 per cent in SRB and 7.9 per cent in SLB cows. The incidence increased markedly with age in both breeds. The risk was rather greater during the grazing than during the housed period. The gestation period was, on average, about 2 days less than in cows with normal expulsion of placenta. \n \n \n \nRetentio secundinarum had a negative effect on fertility. This was most marked in cases when the placenta was non-removable, but the effect was significant also when the placenta was fully removable. \n \n \n \nParenteral administration of up to 60 mg. diethylstilboestrol had per se no negative effect on fertility. \n \n \n \nIn 62 per cent of the cases the placenta was fully removable. It was more difficult to remove after a short than after a normal gestation period. Abnormal vaginal discharges occurred in 62 per cent of the cows. \n \n \n \nZusammenfassung \n \nRetentio secondinarum bei Kuhen (Haufigkeit, klinische Befunde, Einflus auf die Fruchtbarkeit) \n \n \n \nDie Befunde wurden bei 1702 Kuhen erhoben, die kunstlich besamt wurden. 72% der Patienten gehorten der Rasse Swedish red-and-white (SRB), 25% der Swedish Friesian (SLB) und 3% anderen Rassen an. Bei Zwillings-und Totgeburten war der Prozentsatz der Retentio secundinarum (R. s.) erhoht. Auf die Geschlechtsverteilung der Kalber sowie die Ketoseinzidenz hatte die R. s. keinen Einflus, hingegen war eine positive Korrelation zwischen der R. s. und der Paresis puerperalis festzustellen. \n \n \n \nBei reinrassigen SRB-Kuhen betrug die R. s.-Inzidenz 4,8%, bei SLB-Kuhen 7,9%. Mit zunehmendem Alter erhohte sich der Prozentsatz der R. s.- Falle bei beiden Rassen. Wahrend der Weidezeit traten etwas mehr R. s.-Falle auf als wahrend der Stallperiode. Bei den R. s.-Patienten war die Trachtigkeitsdauer 2 Tage kurzer als bei den Tieren ohne R. s. \n \n \n \nDie R. s. beeintrachtigte die Fruchtbarkeit, und zwar am starksten, wenn die Plazenta manuell nicht abgelost werden konnte, aber auch in Fallen, bei denen die Plazenta entfernt werden konnte. \n \n \n \nDiathylstilboestrol (60 mg parenteral) hatte keine negative Wirkung. \n \n \n \nIn 62% der Falle konnte die Plazenta ganz entfernt werden. Die Ablosung war bei den Tieren mit verkurzter Tragzeit etwas schwieriger als bei denjenigen mit normaler Graviditatsdauer.

Le 72% des betes etaient de la race rouge et blanche suedoise (SRB), le 25% de la race frisonne suedoise (SLB) et le 3% d'autres races. Le pourcentage des retentions placentaires fut plus eleve avec les naissances de jumeaux et de mort-nes. La retention placentaire n'a eu aucune influence sur la repartition du sexe des veaux et l'incidence de la cetose, mais a presente par contre une correlation positive avec la paresie puerperale. \n \n \n \nL'incidence de la retention fut de 4,8% chez les vaches de race pure rouge et blanche suedoise et de 7% chez celles de la race frisonne suedoise. Le pourcentage des cas de retention augmenta avec l'\u00e2ge chez les deux races.

La distribucion sexual de los terneros y la incidencia de cetosis eran normales; sin embargo, existia una correlacion positiva entre la r. s. y la paresia puerperal. \n \n \n \nEn vacas SBR de raza pura era la incidencia de r. s. del orden de un 4,8%, mientras que en vacas SLB de un 7,9%. Con la edad creciente aumentaba el porcentaje de los casos de r. s. en ambas razas. El riesgo era mayor durante el pastoreo que en el periodo de estabulacion. En los pacientes con r. s. era 2 dias mas breve la duracion de la gestacion que en los animales sin r. s. \n \n \n \nLa r. s. tenia un efecto negativo sobre la fertilidad, siendo muy pronunciado cuando la placenta no se podia desprender a mano, aunque tambien era significante en los casos en que la placenta se separaba por completo. \n \n \n \nLa administracion parenteral de hasta 60 mg de dietilestilbestrol no ejercia per se ningun efecto negativo sobre la fertilidad. \n \n \n \nEn el 62% de los casos se pudo remover la placenta en su totalidad. El desprendimiento era algo mas dificil en los animales con tiempo de gestacion abreviado que en aquellos con periodo normal de prenez. En el 62% de las vacas se registro flujo vaginal anormal.", "year": 2010, "openAccessPdf": null, "authors": [{"authorId": "13578455", "name": "I. Dyrendahl"}, {"authorId": "153209762", "name": "J.

Cows (n = 53) sired by Bonsmara (BONS; n = 7), Brangus (BRAN; n = 13), Charolais (CHAR; n = 8), Gelbvieh (GELV; n = 5), Hereford (HERF; n = 12), and Romosinuano (ROMO; n = 8) from Brangus dams and their Angus sired calves (n = 51) were used in the study. Horn fly counts (HFC) and milk yield and quality estimates were collected every 28 d from May to October. Pasture behavior (grazing, standing or lying) was recorded monthly twice a day (AM and PM). Exit velocity (EV) and chute score (CS) were obtained from cows and calves monthly. Monthly HFC differed (P < 0.0001), with populations lesser in May (94\u00b142 flies) and greater in August (503\u00b141 flies). The regression coefficients for milk yield on log HFC were not consistent across sire breed (P < 0.05), with milk yield reduced 0.99 and 0.64 kg/d per unit increase in log HFC in GELV and BONS. The regression coefficients of preweaning ADG on log HFC depended on sire breed (P < 0.10), with results indicating preweaning ADG reduced by 0.19 kg/d per one unit increase in HFC in BONS calves (P < 0.05), but not other breeds. A one unit increase in log HFC resulted in 0.07 kg/d (P < 0. 10) increase in postweaning average daily gain (ADG), 19.52 kg increase (P < 0.10) in 365-d adjusted yearling weight (YWT), and 0.05 kg/d (P < 0.02) increase in birth to yearling ADG. Pasture PM behavior was associated with HFC (P < 0.05), with standing cows having fewer flies than those grazing and lying (319 \u00b1 27 vs. 468 \u00b1 52 and 419 \u00b1 38 flies). Exit velocity of cows (P < 0.0001) and calves (P < 0.05) differed monthly. Results from study clearly demonstrated HFC affected milk production, calf performance, and pasture behavior and temperament measurements.

I want to start with my advisors, because without each of you this goal could not have been achieved. Dr. Brown and Dr. Rosenkrans, I will never be able to put into words how much your guidance and mentoring has meant to me. Dr. Rosenkrans your faith in me has never wavered and your kind words, smiling face, and priceless advice over these three years will never be forgotten. Dr. Brown the tasks we have accomplished, challenges we have overcome, enduring advice, and sincere conversations we have had have helped mold me not only into a scientist but a better person. You both have contributed to making me the person I am today and you will forever hold a special place in my heart. To my committee members, Dr. Anthony, Dr., Brown and Dr. Looper, this journey would not have been the same without for the men who make up this committee. Dr. Anthony, the impression you made my first semester will be everlasting. The dynamic you have brought to this committee with your knowledge and belief in me will remain with me for years to come. Dr. Brown you too had a remarkable belief in me. I appreciated the relationship we formed and am proud we had the opportunity to work together. Dr. Looper you have been a wonderful role model and inspiration in my life and future career. It has been a privilege to work with you, get to know you, and experience ASAS board trips together. I feel blessed to have met each of you, worked with you, and got to know you. The impact you have made on my life will continue to influence me as a person and my future decisions as a scientist, and I can only hope to someday have the impact on someone that you had on me. To others who have left an impression, I thank you. Dr. Apple you have always been caring and sincere and I have always appreciated your words and advice. Dr. Coffey, Dr. Kegley, Dr. Kreider, Dr. Kumar, Dr. Powell, Dr. Tucker and Dr. Yazwinsky thank you for allowing me to get to know you and for impacting my life in ways you all are probably not even aware. The secretaries: Linda, Khalissa, Hadley, Jeannie, Diana, and Connie thank you for being the kind faces and backbone of this department. Getting to know you has made my time here more enjoyable and I appreciate all of your hard work and everything you have done for me. My sincerest acknowledgement goes out to my family; Mom, Dad, Shelly, Sarah, and Houston. Mom and Dad you have always believed in me and encouraged me to be whatever I wanted. You both have set an example of what unconditional love is and I cannot thank you enough for all you have done. Shelly, you hurt when I hurt, celebrate when I celebrate and never take for granted our twin time. You have helped me through these past three years in ways I will never be able to express in words, but as my identical twin I know I do not have to because you already know. Sarah, I am proud of who you are, who you have become, and who you want to be. For you and Houston both; remember you can be anything you want and hopefully my journey has inspired you to truly believe this and believe in yourselves. This has been the longest journey of my life and reaching the end would not have been possible without my families love and support. Words cannot express the overwhelming appreciation and love I have for you all. Our family is and has always been the strong foundation that holds all of us together. When one of us is weak the others are there to hold and support. Your support and love has provided the strength I needed to succeed in this challenge and it will continue to provide the strength I need to succeed in the future. Lastly, I want to thank God for leading me down the path he chose and for providing me with the strength I needed to finish the journey. DEDICATION I want to dedicate this dissertation, this degree, and this journey to my husband Travis Mays. You have stood by me, supported me, and held me up. You have provided for me, believed in me, and encouraged me. These past three years have had their challenges and obstacles, but we have overcome them together and created a wonderful family and life in the process. I cannot wait to start the next chapter. Thank you for being my best friend, husband, and the love of my life. You ask what I\u2019m doing, and I say, \u201cLoving you\u201d.", "year": 2013, "openAccessPdf": null, "authors": [{"authorId": "39237554", "name": "A. Mays"}]}

Data were recorded in an experimental Simmental herd in Lower Austria. After applying restrictions, 2895 records of first and 2082 of second calving remained. For estimation of variance\u2013covariance components a REML procedure based on an animal model was used. All estimates for heritabilities and phenotypic correlations of threshold traits were transformed to a hypothetical underlying normal distribution. \n \n \n \nThe estimated heritabilities of retained placenta at first and second calving were 0.14 and 0.07 with a genetic correlation of 0.79. For twinning rate the corresponding figures were 0.19, 0.02 and 1.00, respectively. High genetic correlations were estimated for retained placenta and birth weight of calf at first parity (0.49) as well as between retained placenta and twinning rate at second calving (0.99). The estimated genetic correlations between retained placenta at first and second calving and first lactation milk yield were 0.14 and 0.56 and between retained placenta at first calving and subsequent days open 0.54. Phenotypic correlations were mostly equal in sign but substantially smaller than the corresponding genetic correlations. No significant genetic cytoplasmic effects could be found for retained placenta. \n \n \n \nThere was strong evidence (p < 0.001) that twin-births, calving difficulties (dystocia) and relatively short and long gestation periods substantially affected the incidence of retained placenta. Partial and complete retention of the placenta at first calving led to an increase of 34 and 4 days open (p < 0.001), respectively. The estimated decrease of first lactation milk yield (250 days) was 67 and 128 kg due to partial and complete retention of the placenta (p = 0.154). \n \n \n \nThe results obtained suggest that the genetic determination of placental retention is strong enough to be considered in breeding strategies even if its heritability should be somewhat lower under field conditions than in the analysed experimental herd. \n \n \n \nZusammenfassung \n \nNachgeburtsverhaltung: Nicht-genetische Effekte, genetische Determinierung und Korrelationen zu relevanten Leistungsmerkmalen beim Rind \n \n \n \nZiel der vorliegenden Untersuchung war die Schatzung der genetischen Determinierung und des Einflusses nicht-genetischer Effekte auf zeitliche Unterschiede im Abgang der Nachgeburt beim Rind, sowie deren genetische und phanotypische Korrelation zu relevanten Milchleistungs- und Reproduktionsmerkmalen. Fur die Untersuchung standen die Milchleistungsprufergebnisse der Jahre 1972 bis 1995 von Tieren der Fleckvieh-Versuchsherde der niederosterreichischen Bundesversuchswirtschaft Wieselburg zur Verfugung, bei denen das Merkmal \u2018Nachgeburtsverhaltung\u2019 erhoben worden war (2895 bzw. 2082 Erhebungen fur 1. bzw. 2. Abkalbung). \n \n \n \nDie geschatzte Heritabilitat fur das Merkmal Nachgeburtsverhaltung betrug fur die 1. und 2. Abkalbung 0.14 bzw. 0.07, wahrend zytoplasmatische Geneffekte fur dieses Merkmal nicht nachweisbar waren. Eine enge genetische Merkmalskorrelation wurde zwischen einer Nachgeburtsverhaltung bei der 1. und der 2. Geburt geschatzt (0.79), aber auch zwischen der Milchmenge der vorangegangenen Laktation und einer Nachgeburtsverhaltung bei der darauffolgenden Geburt (0.56). Betrachtlich im Ausmas und statistisch gut abgesichert ist auch der negative Einflus von Schwer-und Zwillingsgeburten, sowie einer sehr langen bzw. sehr kurzen Trachtigkeitsdauer auf den Abgang der Nachgeburt. Als recht gravierend erwies sich die im Durchschnitt um 34 Tage verlangerte Serviceperiode in der folgenden Laktation durch eine teilweise Verhaltung der Nachgeburt (p < 0.001), wahrend bei einer totalen Verhaltung nur eine Verlangerung um 4 Tage auftrat. Fur eine teilweise bzw. vollstandige Verhaltung der Nachgeburt wurde eine durchschnittliche Verschlechterung der Milchmengenleistung in der ersten Laktation um 67 bzw. 128 kg geschatzt. \n \n \n \nDie genetische Fundierung des Merkmales Nachgeburtsverhaltung erscheint als ausreichend hoch, um eine Verbesserung dieses Merkmales durch entsprechende Zuchtmasnahmen in Erwagung zu ziehen, auch wenn dessen Heritabilitat unter Feldbedingungen etwas niedriger sein sollte als in der analysierten Versuchsherde.", "year": 1998, "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdfdirect/10.1111/j.1439-0388.1998.tb00368.x", "status": "BRONZE"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "88294368", "name": "S.

Seven hundred and eighty-three first-service dairy cows were synchronized with 2 injections of PGF2 14 days apart, starting on Day 35 postpartum. Six days before the second PGF2 injection, cows were assigned to 2 groups: P4 and control. The P4 group (n\u2009=\u2009387) received a progesterone-releasing intravaginal device and an intramuscular injection of 500 mg of progesterone. The control group (n\u2009=\u2009396) did not receive the progesterone-releasing intravaginal device or progesterone injection. Cows were inseminated 12 h after exhibiting oestrus. Pregnancy diagnosis was performed 40 and 45 days after insemination by rectal palpation and the cumulative pregnancy rate on Day 90 postpartum was determined retrospectively through the individual records. The response to the progesterone treatment varied according to the parity of the cows (P < 0.05). Thus, progesterone administration improved the percentage of cows detected in oestrus in multiparous [192/255 (75.2%) v. 161/267 (60.2%)] but not in primiparous [93/132 (70.4%) v. 90/129 (69.7%)] cows. Progesterone treatment increased pregnancy rate in multiparous [53/192 (27.6%) v. 27/161 (16.7%)] but not in primiparous cows [25/93 (26.8%) v. 29/90 (32.2%)]. Likewise, progesterone administration increased the cumulative percentage of pregnant cows on day 90 postpartum in multiparous [149/255 (58.4%) v. 129/267 (48.3%)] but not in primiparous cows [77/132 (58.3%) v. 82/129 (63.5%)]. The incidence of twin births was lower (P\u2009=\u20090.07) in cows treated with progesterone [1/74 (1%)] than in the control group [4/53 (7%)]. It is concluded that progesterone administration before oestrus synchronization with PGF2 in first service dairy cows improves oestral response, increases pregnancy rate, and percentage of pregnant animals on Day 90 postpartum in multiparous cows, but not in primiparous cows, and decreases the incidence of twin births.

Any two animals taken at random, therefore, will almost invariably possess distinct blood types. A study of bovine twins, however, disclosed a much higher proportion of identical blood types than is expected in view of the relatively low frequency of monozygotous twinning in cattle.3 Owen pointed out that this high proportion of identical blood types could be accounted for as a consequence of the known frequent union of chorionic blood vessels of twin fetuses, as demonstrated by Lillie.4 Apparently, embryonal blood cells are interchanged by those twins having a common circulatory system and these primordial cells settle in the hematopoietic tissues where they serve as a source of erythrocytes throughout the life of each twin. The identity of blood types in otherwise genetically dissimilar twins would thus .result from a mixture of two kinds of erythrocytes, namely, those produced by (a) the twin's own cells and (b) cells transplanted from the co-twin. Several lines of evidence, including the in vitro separation of the two kinds of erythrocytes comprising the mosaic of blood cells, afford proof of this explanation. It is now found that the cellular character called J constitutes an exception to the general rule in that twins possessing a blood admixture nevertheless may differ in respect to the presence or absence of this blood factor. The present report is concerned with the reasons for this non-conformity in behavior of character J. Each of the numerous antigenic factors of cattle erythrocytes is recognized by the reaction (hemolysis) of these cells produced by a corresponding reagent (antibodies) and complement (fresh rabbit serum). For example, erythrocytes of an individual that possesses a gene for antigen A are sensitized by the action of A reagent and subsequently destroyed (hemolysed) by the action of the complement, while those of an animal that lacks gene A 2N32 PROC.

Ovulation rate, follicular characteristics, and luteal responses were determined. In Exp. 1, three groups of estrous-synchronized, cyclic Holstein heifers were treated once daily, on d 3 to 6 of the cycle, with a FSH product (Folltropin-V): large FSH dose (total of 150 mg; n=18), medium FSH dose (total of 130 mg, n=12), and small FSH dose (total of 80 mg; n=7). Controls received saline (n=6). Prostaglandin F(2\u03b1) was injected on d 6, ultrasound-guided aspiration of surplus follicles (if needed) was performed on d 7, and GnRH was injected on d 8 to induce ovulation. The large FSH dose induced growth of more (2.6\u00b10.3, P<0.05) large follicles than controls on d 8; medium and small FSH doses insufficiently stimulated growth of <2 large follicles. Ovulation rates were determined in subgroups of heifers (n=10, 13, 4, and 6, respectively). The large FSH dose induced greater rates (P<0.01) of mostly double and triple ovulations (90% multiple ovulations, 70% double ovulations), most of which (89%) were bilateral, with only 2 out of 10 heifers requiring aspiration of surplus follicles. Medium and small FSH doses induced fewer multiple ovulations (38% and 25%, respectively). Estradiol concentrations on d 8 did not differ among treatments, but the concentration per large follicle in controls was greater (P<0.05) than in FSH treatments. Mean corpus luteum (CL) volume in single-ovulation controls was greater (P<0.05) than that of multiple ovulations in the large FSH group and total CL volume and progesterone concentrations were numerically greater in multiple ovulations. In Exp. 2, the characteristics of follicles aspirated on d 7 from large FSH (n=11) and control heifers (n=10) were compared. Based on estradiol-to-progesterone ratio, 57% of the large FSH-treated follicles were classified as codominant/healthy follicles and 43% as subordinate/early atretic. Although concentrations of estradiol and androstenedione in FSH-treated codominant follicles were less (P<0.05) than in controls, estradiol-to-progesterone ratio indicated that those follicles were steroidogenically active.

Several techniques have been used to study and define this locus but they are generally time consuming and limited in their ability to detect novel alleles. In this study we used denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE), and direct sequencing, for BoLA-DRB3-typing. First, modified locus-specific primers were used in polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to amplify a 240 bp fragment of exon 2 of BoLA-DRB3 from the genomic DNA of 22 cattle and one pair of twin calves. The reverse primer included a GC-rich clamp to improve the physical separation of the BoLA-DRB3 alleles by DGGE. The denaturing gradient needed to produce separation of alleles was determined using perpendicular DGGE, and this gradient was then applied to parallel denaturing gels. The optimal time for producing allele separation was determined using a time-series analysis. The bands representing individual BoLA-DRB3 alleles were excised from the gels, reamplified, and the nucleotide sequence determined using fluorescent-based automated cycle sequencing. The nucleotide sequences of the separated bands were then compared to published BoLA-DRB3 alleles. A gradient of 10-15% acrylamide combined with a 15-50% ureaformamide gradient was successfully used to separate BoLA-DRB3 alleles in all individuals examined. Nucleotide sequencing showed that the 24 animals possessed 13 BoLA-DRB3 alleles, all of which have been previously described. The BoLA-DRB3 genotypes included 20 heterozygotes and two homozygotes. Three BoLA-DRB3 alleles were seen in each of the twin calves, possibly due to leukochimerism. The technique is reliable and rapid, and avoids cloning alleles prior to nucleotide sequencing and therefore offers distinct advantages over previous techniques for BoLA-DRB3-typing.", "year": 1998, "openAccessPdf": null, "authors": [{"authorId": "7225114", "name": "B.

This paper presented factors and technology that increase twinning rate and the impacts of twin births in cattle. There are genetic and non genetic factors affecting twinning rate. Increased twin births can be done through some technologies such as selection, reproduction and management. The problems in twinnings are the high incidence of abortion, early embryonic loss, distochia, retained placenta, metabolic disorders, and ketosis resulting in longer calving interval. Intensive management to dam bearing twins can reduce the problems. Economically, the profits of twinning are different between beef and dairy cattle.

Additionally, it will discuss a methodology for a quick and accurate diagnosis of cell chimerism and make an analysis of cells obtained from gonads of animals derived from twin pregnancies which underwent an exchange of hematopoietic tissue as a result of anastomoses. The studies reviewed here led the authors to conclude that XX/XY chimerism is generally undesirable in livestock breeding.

Traits of the exterior, milk productivity and quality indicators of milk, lactation dynamics, reproductive traits, calving, culling and predisposition to animal diseases were studied. Some problems were identified related to the main traits characterizing a stock of cattle. Reproductive problems were shown up. Calves per 100 cows were 76-78 heads in different years, the fertility rate was 48%, the average insemination index was 2.05, the interval from calving to 1 insemination \u2014 87.9 days. The period of economic use of cows is reducing. The quality traits of milk are deteriorating (milk fat content \u2014 3.3%, protein \u2014 2.95%). The main directions of further improvement of Holstein Kholmogorskaya cattle in the Murmansk region are identified: an improvement of reproduction traits, an increase of the period of economic use and an increase of the level of mass fraction of fat and protein in milk. Target indicators of economically useful traits are determined. Upgrading these characteristics to the target level will significantly improve the quality characteristics of livestock. In reproduction, the increasing calves per 100 cows to 80 heads and the fertility rate of cows at the first insemination to 60%, the reducing the insemination index to 1.5, the decreasing the calving interval from calving to 1st insemination by 8 days (to 80 days), and endeavour to reduce the frequency of reproductive diseases, the number of stillborn calves, to increase the number of twins, the alive of calves at an early age. The decreasing of the frequency of lameness, ketoses, paresis and other metabolic diseases, mastitis and reproductive diseases, and the improvement of the exterior traits (udder, limbs, and pelvis) will increase in the longevity of cows. The improvement of the level of animal feeding and balancing of rations will increase (to target values) in fat content (4.0%) and protein (3.1%) in cow's milk with maintaining high milk productivity.

After recovery from infection, calves were resistant to challenge. Challenge with sporozoites was followed sometimes by an immediate reappearance or by a later peak, or sometimes by twin peaks of cytotoxic cells but macroschizonts were not detected.

Cows that had the first insemination (AI) between 40 and 150 d postpartum were selected. The first AI was classified as successful when cows were not reinseminated and either calved between 267 and 295 d later or were culled within 135 to 295 d after first AI.

The lactation curve characteristics (peak milk yield, milk yield at the first-AI date, time of peak yield (PT), and milk persistency) were calculated. Breed, parity, interval from calving to first AI (CFI), lactation curve characteristics, milk production traits, moment of AI related to PT (before or after PT), calf status, month of AI, and month of calving were selected as independent variables for a model with SFI as a dependent variable. A multivariable logistic regression model was used with farm as a random effect. Overall SFI was 44%. The effect of parity on SFI depended on CFI.

Aberrant DNA methylation patterns have frequently been associated with carcinogenesis, with a general loss of genomic 5-methylcytosine and a hypermethylation of particular genes. Therefore, the analysis of the genomic methylation level (5-meC) would provide a comprehensive tool for the correlation between 5-meC-mediated biological variations and cancer development as well as other cell abnormalities. \nCapillary electrophoresis coupled with laser induced fluorescence detector (CE-LIF) is the method used in the whole work for the analysis of DNA modifications and requires the presence of the phosphate group in the 3' position of 2'-deoxyribose of the nucleotide to be analysed after its derivatisation with the fluorescent marker BODIPY. Therefore, the first section in this study focused on the synthesis of the modified 8-oxo-2'-deoxyguanosine-3'-monophosphate (8-oxo-dGMP) nucleotide, its characterisation with ESI-MS and its detection by CE-LIF. 8-Oxo-dGMP is used as biomarker for oxidative stress to assess the influence of oxidative stress on the methylation level. A correlation between oxidative stress (8-oxo-dGMP) and promotion of carcinogenesis was established via another biomarker, the methylation level, but further studies are necessary for verification. \nThe second part of this work was the study of the change of methylation level in response to several carcinogens either natural products such as aristolochic acid (AA) or environmental pollutants - 3-nitro-benzanthrone (3-NBA), benzo[\u0391]pyrene B[\u0391]P and 4-aminobiphenyl (4-ABP) - in either in-vivo or in-vitro studies in order to find whether there is a correlation between the methylation level and the carcinogen-adduct formation. The results showed different patterns in the methylation level according to the tested organ, confirming a specificity of the methylation level that can distinguish different tissues. The variability of the methylation level among several analysed tissues provides insight into the role of related biological factors in cancer formation via epigenetic modification. \nFinally, a great part of this work focused on the determination of the DNA methylation level in clones of Simmental and Holstein breeds of cattle and in Simmental twins to clarify some epigenetic approaches toward cloning. Successful somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT) cloning is compatible with the birth of live offspring in a wide range of mammalian species; however the low overall efficiency of the technology could be related to the failure of epigenetic reprogramming. Clones that survive into adulthood, in contrast, are judged to be normal, and the epigenetic marks required for their normal development are assumed to have been retained; however, the epigenetic status of such healthy adult clones has never been investigated. CE-LIF analysis revealed that individual methylation levels of circulating white blood cells of bovine clones ranged from 4.4 % to 6.9 % with significant differences between the mean 5-meC levels of Holstein and Simmental clones (6.50 % \u00b1 0.01 % and 5.09 % \u00b1 0.02 %, < 0.001). In addition, in order to judge the contribution of SCNT to the variability of individual 5-meC levels, further analyses were carried out to compare Simmental clones with 12 sets of similarly aged female monozygotic Simmental twins experimentally generated from bisected fertilised embryos as well as to compare Holstein clones with the mother nuclear donor cows. The methylation level of clones is higher than the nuclear donor animals or in contemporary monozygotic twins. The absolute deviations of 5-meC values of individual SCNT clones from their genotype means were five times as high as in twins. Finally, it is concluded that global DNA methylation levels of leukocytes of healthy adult clones are in fact highly variable between individuals of the same genotype and between genotypes of different breeds that call for an in-depth analysis of genetic and epigenetic risks associated with SCNT cloning.", "year": 2009, "openAccessPdf": null, "authors": [{"authorId": "1403110954", "name": "Dalia El-Zeihery"}]}

In the twenty-first century, it may be time to reassess our treatment of sheep and their place in nature. \u201cJust because we\u2019ve always done it\u201d no longer has validity by itself. There are many other human practices which used to be accepted widely in certain societies and which we now may find abhorrent. With sheep intelligence now rightly regarded as an acceptable area of research within the academic community, it is a good time to reflect on our treatment of these animals and suggest possible alternative scenarios. Joyce D\u2019Silva has an MA from Dublin University (Trinity College) and honorary degrees from the Universities of Winchester (D. Litt) and Keele (D. Univ). She was Chief Executive of Compassion in World Farming from 19912005. She now works as Ambassador Emeritus. Joyce played a key role in achieving the UK ban on sow stalls and in getting recognition of animal sentience enshrined in the European Union Treaties. She has published widely on farm animal welfare. Website Sheep rearing for meat and wool (and sometimes milk) has a long history within human agricultural activities. But the longevity of a practice does not in itself confer ethical status. \u201cJust because we\u2019ve always done it\u201d no longer has validity. We have only to reflect on other long-standing human practices, such as slavery, subjugation of women, or infanticide and human sacrifice to realise this. The twenty-first century may be a good time to reassess our traditional use of sheep and their place in nature. Traditional sheep rearing was in flocks where maybe one person could care for them, lead them to new pastures, and help with daily health and welfare problems. Slaughter may have been speedy and on site or nearby \u2013 a quick inversion (or in the case of lambs, being lifted up) and a knife to the throat. Today sheep are often raised in massive flocks, sometimes several thousand strong, belonging to one individual or company. Individual care is unlikely to be possible. We know that in the Australian outback, ewes having problematic births, or animals who have gone lame, are unlikely to receive treatment. Even in New Zealand, with its reputation for free range, pasture-based farming, \u201ceasy care lambing\u201d is the norm. Ewes are left to lamb out on the range and if problems occur, they are unlikely to receive attention. The timing of lambing has been manipulated by farmers to suit the market. Ewes may have melatonin sponges inserted into their vaginas to hasten oestrus and early lambing. Although indoor lambing is more common in the UK, hundreds of early lambs still die every year, many from hypothermia (Sheep Health and Welfare Group 2018/19). Animal Sentience 2019.214: D\u2019Silva on Marino & Merskin on Sheep Complexity 2 Breeders aim for ewes to produce twin lambs to increase profitability. This inevitably results in more triplets being born, often with dire consequences for the health of the mother and of the lambs (Hindson and Winter 2002). Sheep farming has quite literally become a global industry, with live animals or carcases being traded from country to country and continent to continent. Lambs from Scotland may be trucked live to Greece and end up on tourist dinner plates in Athens, and sheep from Australia are shipped in their millions to countries in the Middle East every year, often with many dying on the way and the arrivals likely to face non-stun slaughter in their destination lands. In 2017, the European Commission investigated the export of live animals (cattle, sheep and goats) from the European Union (EU) to Turkey. The findings were stark and emblematic of all that is wrong with long-distance transport. They concluded that \u201cthere is a high risk of unnecessary pain and distress for transported animals and a high risk for transporters to breach EU rules\u201d (European Commission 2017). Creating huge flocks has had devastating environmental impacts over the years, with desertification now becoming such a problem in Mongolia and northern China that the sheep are being moved into feedlots. Even in Wales, the hills have been transformed over the centuries, from forests to grazing areas, and over-grazing has denuded much of the pasture land itself. Marino & Merskin (2019) have done sheep a service by bringing together the growing body of science which tells us how intelligent and emotionally aware sheep truly are. It is important that policy shapers and makers read their paper and that society is alerted to its findings in an appropriate way. The striking disparity between eating lamb chops for dinner and providing loving care and often vast amounts of money for the well-being of our companion animals needs to be realised. Only then may the practice of eating sheep be called into question. Perhaps society may come to pay more regard to the welfare of the sheep they eat and purchase only sheep reared on high-welfare farms and where they can guarantee that the animal has been slaughtered with care and pre-stunning. Perhaps the horrors of the longdistance trade in sheep will be banned. Perhaps society will eventually abandon the eating of sheep and other currently farmed animals altogether. Right now is a good time to reflect on these possibilities, and perhaps take action.", "year": 2019, "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://www.wellbeingintlstudiesrepository.org/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1438&context=animsent", "status": "GOLD"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "1410583113", "name": "J.

To have higher conclusions\u2019 reliability on population data one did longevity and reproductive ability data analysis of culled 346 Whiteheaded Ukrainian cows, which were born during 1978\u20131995. Analysis of productive longevity of investigated cows testified, that in the herd cows with the productive longevity in 1\u20135 lactations dominated (74,6%). Only 25 cows (7,2%) had 1 calving. The largest number of cows (70 animals) in the herd had 4\u00a0calvings.

However, one should admit, that the majority (75%) of used in the herd bulls had no still-birth or abortion with different matches.

In contrast, the ratio of fetal numbers to ovulation sites in pregnant females with twin (0.83) or triplet (0.73) ovulations is <1.0 and the number of calves per parturition is 1.6 and 2.0, respectively. Failure of individual twin or triplet ovulations to yield a conceptus in fertile females indicates a significant contribution of ovulation or oocyte anomalies to increased fertilization failure or early embryonic mortality. The present objective was to identify physiological traits affecting conception in cyclic cattle expressing multiple ovulations naturally, including the effect of ovulation rate on follicle or corpus luteum (CL) size, and their relationship to conception. Diameter of the individual ovulatory follicles was measured by transrectal ultrasonography at AI and ranged from 8 to 30 mm, with a trend for diameter of the individual follicles, and associated CL, to decrease with increasing ovulation rate. Independent of ovulation rate, ovulatory follicles were smaller (P < 0.05) for nulliparous heifers (1.5 yr) compared with parous cows (\u22652.5 yr). Pregnancy and fetal status were diagnosed by transrectal ultrasonography between 42 and 72 d after AI. Fertility was reduced (P < 0.01) for small twin or triplet ovulatory follicles (8 to 8.9 mm vs. 10 to 17.9 mm diam.), whereas fertility in monovular females was reduced (P < 0.01) for large ovulatory follicles (\u226522 vs. 14 to 17.9 mm). Plasma progesterone concentrations increased with ovulation rate and were correlated positively with total CL or ovulatory follicle volume per female, indicating that CL size and function were influenced by the size of the follicle of origin. Progesterone was greater (P < 0.05) in the blood of nulliparous heifers compared with parous cows. The increased proportion of small ovulatory follicles associated with twin and triplet ovulations indicates that some ovulatory follicles were either selected to ovulate at a lesser stage of maturity or rescued while undergoing atresia, thus compromising oocyte competency or ovulation. Of greatest importance for reduced fertility was the greater incidence of pregnancy losses occurring in the middle of gestation in females gestating 2 or more fetuses as an apparent effect of uterine crowding, especially when 2 or more fetuses were contained within 1 uterine horn.", "year": 2009, "openAccessPdf": null, "authors": [{"authorId": "5758319", "name": "S.

IN his Primitive Mentality' Professor LEVY-BRUHL of the Sorbonne takes as a working hvpothesis hiis previous work set out in Les Fonctions M1entales dans les Societes In/trieures, published in 1910. As the translator, Mims CLARE, -states in the preface to the English version, the earlier book laid special stress upon the law of participation,considered in relation to the principle of identity, and also upon the fact that the primitive 'has little perception of the law of contradiction. In his new book Professor Levy-Brulil aims at showing what causation means to primitives and the inferences to be derived from their idea of it. In his introductory remarks the author argues that the .primitive's distaste for the discursive operations of thought, the restriction of his ideas to a small number of objects, and his lack of reflection, are not due to inlierent incapacity or natural inaptitude; to understand the problem properly, we must recognize that the primitive makes no distinction between this world and the other, between what is actually present to sense and what is beyond. He actually dwells with invisible spirits and intangible forces, and to him it is these that are the real and actual. Professor Levy-Bruhl asks us to abandon the -belief that primitive minds are orientated like our own and react as ours do to the impressions made upon tlhem; for, when we find they fail so to do we are apt to explain this failure bv such hypotheses as the feebleness and torpidity of their minds, stupidity, perplexity, child-like ignorance, etc. This' merely leads to defining beforehand the mental activity of primitives as a rudimentairy form of our own, and consequently to considering it as piuerile and almost pathological. The primitive's indifference to secondary causes; his fear of nwstic and invisible forces, dreams and omens; his practices of divination; his firm faith in the test of ordeal; the mystic meanings he puts into accident, misfortune, and the causes 'of success; the equally mystic meaning of the white man's appearance and of the things he brings with him; his dislike of the unknown and his reluctanee to abandon old customs in favour of new through fear of giving offence to ancestors and spirits by too rieady acceptance of clhange, with his consequent attitude to European remedies-are'all 'dealt with in a higlylv attractive manner throughout the fourteen chapters of a most erudite book. In interesting chapters discussing the subject of omens the author deals, amongst many other things, with the primitive's fear of facts or events which are unusual, or of individuals who are more or less teratological, like the monstra and portenta of the Romans. When an omeni of this kind appears the universal plan is to cancel it as quickly as possible: to guard against that which the monster portends it must be made to vanislh. Abnormal presentations are dealt with by the primitives as a' dangerous portent-for example, in footling births the child is slain, while if a goat is giving birth to a kid and the lhead appears first the animal is slaughtered. Wh'here a woman, in labour for the first time, gives birtli to twins \" an old woman of the village (amongst'the Kikuytu of East Africa), generally the midwife, stuffs grass into their mouths until they are suffocated, and then throws them out into the bush. If a cow or a goat bears twins the first time, the same practice is observed.\" In British East Africa, if a child is born feet foremost it is smothered. The reasois given are that if the infant is permitted to live their crops will all wither up from drought, their cattle will die, and many other evils befall them. Especial fear is shown of children who cut their upper teeth first, as tliev prevent the rain from falling. To counteract this, suchi children are buried alive in wet ground. It is interesting to note the survival of a feeling of \" uncanniness \" about such an event in Scotland, although there the belief is attenuated and the risk falls oni the child itself: \"They that cut their teeth abune, Will never wear their marriage shoon.\" In the Belgian Congo these children are the children of woe, and are either thrown into water or exposed to wild beasts. If mother-love saves the unfortunate infant, it is later sold into slavery, for, if living in the village, it causes all the misfortunes that occur there, and the father and mother are continually twitted with the fact of having hrought such a being into the world, and held up to universal derision. Tlle abnormal child is on the same. level as the possessor of an evil eye, 'and to the native mind there is no cruelty in the slaying of it; it is merely a measure undertaken for the public safety; the social group must lno longer be kept in contact with it.

Twinning is an important non-infectious cause of pregnancy loss in mares and should not occur on wellmanaged breeding farms and reduction in the incidence of twin births can result in a saving of as much as $55 million per year (Johanson et al., 2001). The incidence of twinning is very high (60-70%) in sheep and goat, whereas low in dairy cattle (1.04%) and mare (0.51.05%) (Roberts 1971). The twins were assumed to be dizygotic (Johanson et al., 2001). This type of twining arises due to fertilization of two ova by two separate sperms. Dizygotic are the most common type of twin, may be of the same or different sex and are more than two-thirds of live twin births. The present case report deals with a rare case of dystocia due to twinning in a Hariana cow. A pluriparous cow of four and a half year age in her third parity was brought to the Teaching Veterinary Clinical Complex, College of Veterinary Sciences Hisar. The cow was suffering from dystocia due to wedging of twins in maternal pelvis. At initial stage, straining was prominent and obstetrical manoeuvres were used by a local veterinarian to relieve dystocia. Per-vaginal examination revealed the presence of two heads in anterior longitudinal presentation with more than two forelimbs in the birth canal. On examination, it was suspected to be a case of monstrosities and hence caesarean section was performed. The animal was prepared for aseptic surgery in lateral recumbency. The incision was given lateral and parallel to milk vein under local anesthesia by using 2% lignocaine hydrochloride (Lox 2% Neon). Following caesarean section, two individual normal dead fetuses were delivered. Externally both the fetuses were identical and separated from each other, had two heads, four forelimbs, two pelvises, four hind limbs and two tails (Fig. 1).

We had generated 28 sperm whole genome sequencing (WGBS) data from healthy individuals. We detected 46 variably methylated regions (VMRs) significantly (P < 5.77 \u00d7 10\u22125) associated with reproduction traits. These significant VMRs were also co-localized (\u00b110 kb) with genes related to sperm motility and reproduction, including ZFP36L1, CRISP2 and HGF. To further identify epigenomic markers associated with reproduction and production traits, we generated WGBS dada for a specific pair of monozygotic twin artificial insemination Holstein bulls with moderately different sperm qualities (Bull1 > Bull2). We found 528 differentially methylated regions between the twin bulls, which spanned or overlapped with 309 differentially methylated genes (DMG). These DMG were particularly associated with reproduction, embryo development and the nervous system. To further obtain DNA methylation markers involved in the diversity of porcine reproduction and production traits due to long-term artificial selection, we profiled sperm DNA methylation of three commercial pig breeds--Duroc, Landrace and Large White. we found the hypomethylated regions (HMRs) were highly conserved among pig breeds, while 1040\u20131666 breed-specific HMRs were identified and associated with the QTLs of embryonic developmental and phenotypic changes. By integrating reduced representation bisulfite sequencing public data of pig testis, we further defined 1743 conservative HMRs between sperm and testis, which may play a role in spermatogenesis process. Overall, our studies demonstrated associations of sperm DNA methylation with bovine and porcine production and reproduction traits, highlighting the potential of epigenomic information in genomic improvement programs for livestock.

Methods: A total of 21 women suffering from unexplained infertility received E2 (2mg PO BID or 0.1mg/day transdermally), starting on day 25 of the previous cycle or 3 days before menses. Blood samples and 1st void urine specimens were obtained for 7 days, starting on the last day on E2. Urinary samples were subjected to filtration before measurement of FSH and creatinin (C). Results were expressed in mIU/mL for serum (sFSH) and urinary FSH (uFSH) and inmIU/mgofC for uFSH/C. Ultrasound evaluations were performed 12 days after stopping E2 for identification of a growing follicle (>12mm). Results: uFSH and uFSH/C showed a high degree of correlation with sFSH (r \u00bc 0.52 and 0.63, p<0.0001 and p<0.0001 for uFSH and uFSH/C, respect- ively). Analysis of sFSH values identified an inter-cycle FSH signal in 15/21 patients with an acme occurring 2, 3 and 4 days after discontinuation of E2 treatment in 4, 5 and 6 patients, respectively. Urinary measurements identified the inter-cycle signal in all women in whom it was detected by blood measure- ments and in none in whom sFSH measurements revealed no FSH elevation followingdiscontinuationof E2. The acme of the urinaryinter-cycle FSH signal was identified on the same day in 12/15 patients and 1 day earlier or 1 day later in 1 and 2 patients, respectively. The amplitude of the inter-cycle FSH signal was of 10.9\u00b14.2 and 34.1\u00b115.9mIU/ml (mean+SD) in sFSH and uFSH, respectively, indicating that urinary measurements amplify the FSH signal by a factor of 3.2 on average. In 4/6 women who had no FSH elevation, no maturing follicle was identified on day 12, confirming the absence of follicular recruitment. The remaining 2 patients showed evidence of ovulation, indicating that they escaped E2 treatment. Conclusion: Our results validate the method proposed for measuring FSH in morning urine specimens, indicating that measuring uFSH and uFSH/C in repeated urine samples offer a simple way for reliably identifying the acme of the inter-cycle FSH signal. Furthermore, urinary measurements amplifying the inter-cycle FSH signal\u2019s amplitude allow to screen not just for increases in inter-cycle FSH signal that reflect failing ovaries, but also for decreases in signal amplitude, as encountered in case of stress. first 200 patients included in the study were analysed according to the intention-to-treat principle.

The non-medical costs during treatment were higher for the standard strategy ( d 4330 versus d 3300), mainly due to high costs for absence of work.

Conclusion: It\u2019s possible to achieve equal pregnancy rates with less multiple pregnancies with mild stimulation and single embryo transfer compared with standard stimulation and double embryo transfer. Despite an increased mean number of cycles, the overall costs per ongoing pregnancy decreased, mainly due to the health economic benefits of the reduction of multiple pregnancies in the mild stimulation approach. application. in the mild stimulation group and 61.1% in the standard stimulation group (p \u00bc 0.8). The multiple pregnancy rate was 2% in the mild stimulation group and 23.9% in the standard stimulation group. The mean number of cycles in one year was 2.43 in the mild stimulation group and 1.89 in the standard stimulation group (p \u00bc 0.001). Conclusions: Mild stimulation with single embryo transfer can result in similar cumulative pregnancy rates over 1 year of treatment compared to standard stimulation with two embryo transfer, while greatly reducing multiple pregnancy rates. Introduction: High multiple pregnancy rate accounts for most of severe obstetric and neonatal problems associated with assisted reproduction treatment (ART). Significant decrease in number of twin pregnancies is efficiently achieved by elective single embryo transfer (eSET) policy, while clinical pregnancy rates have remained stable. The outcome of whole pregnancy after eSET has, however, not been assessed. In this prospective follow-up study we evaluate the outcome of eSET singletons as compared to other ART and control singletons. Materials and methods: Voluntary pregnant women (ART; n \u00bc 496 and con- trols n \u00bc 400) were recruited to a two year follow-up study on obstetric and psychosocial outcome of ART families in 1999. For the object of this study we analysed 330 ART (IVF \u00bc 131; ICSI \u00bc 59; FET \u00bc 140) and 304 control pregnancies. Forty-five of the included ART pregnancies followed eSET. Treatment cycles were given at the Infertility Clinics of Helsinki University Central Hospital, Family Federation Clinics and the Helsinki Deaconess Institute. Data was collected by postal questionnaires at the 20th gestational week and 2 months after birth. In addition complete treatment, medical and obstetric histories were collected at recruitment. Statistic analyses were undertaken using chi-square and t-tests. Results: The mean age participants and the prevalence of obstetric complications were comparable in ART and control groups. ART children were born in earlier gestational weeks (39.7 range 26\u201342 versus 39.9 range 32\u201342, P \u00bc 0.02) and their mean birth weight was lower than in controls (3493g range 975\u20134820g versus 3630g range 1635\u20135965g, P \u00bc 0.001). Medical induction of delivery (29% versus 19%, P \u00bc 0.003), caesarean sections (27% versus 19%, P \u00bc 0.03), and vacuum extractions (10% versus 5%, P \u00bc 0.01) were more com-mon in the ART group. Neonatal outcomes in Apgar-scores, admission to neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) and perinatal mortality rates were similar in all comparisons. In the eSET group, mean gestational age at delivery (39.2 range 34\u201342) and mean birth weight (3453g range 2275\u20134770g) were in accordance to those of the rest ART singletons. The onset of delivery in eSET group was more frequently spontaneous than in the ART group (74% versus 54% respectively, P \u00bc 0.01). Moreover no difference in the delivery mode between the eSET and the control group was discovered. Conclusions: In terms of spontaneous vaginal delivery obstetric outcome in eSET group was better than those in the ART group. The elevated rate of preterm birth and lower birth weight were, however, constant findings regard- less of number of embryos transferred. Fortunately all premature eSET babies were born close to term gestational weeks and none was admitted to NICU. In further investigations, indication of eSET could highlight the associations with preterm birth and low birth weight. development. Moreover, ESC-fertilized oocytes displayed a higher rate of blastocyst formation compared to those injected with an adult somatic cell. We were able to maintain the stemness of the ESCs used as male gametes by generating blastocysts whose ICM restored pluripotency. Pregnancy rates were 21% (19/90) and 31% (83/265) for eSET patients compared to DET patients, respectively (P \u00bc 0.08). Implantation rates were 25% and 20% for periods I and II, respectively. The addition of pregnancies obtained with frozen-thawed embryos gave cumulative pregnancy rates of 24.4% and 35.8% for eSET patients and DET patients, respectively. Twenty-five (25.3%) twin pregnancies were observed for DET patients. Conclusions: The adoption of the eSET policy effectively eliminates multiple pregnancies while reducing pregnancy rate for eSET patients in the studied group. The difference is reduced when taking into account pregnancies obtained with thawed embryos. More patients should be included to draw a definite conclusion for patients with average quality embryos. eSET (445 fresh ET and 548 FET cycles) and DET (double embryo transfer; 587 fresh ET and 280 FET cycles). Results: Age and BMI were comparable in both groups. Pregnancy rate/ET (29.7 versus 29.6%) and live birth rate (23.4 versus 21.6%) in the fresh ET cycle were similar after eSET and DET, respectively. However, patients in the eSET group had a higher cumulative PR per ovum pickup (48.8% versus 34.9%) and a higher cumulative live birth rate (40.0% versus 26.2%, p <0.0001), compared to those in the DET group. The cumulative twin rate in eSET was 1.1% while in DET it was 19.5% ( p <0.0001). Conclusions: The present results indicate that the eSET policy is effective and does not compromise the clinical results in patients aged 36\u201339. The outcome was similar to that observed in women <36 years. Therefore, the eSET policy is applicable to all women until the age of 40 years as DET results in an unacceptably high twin birth rate in this age group. regard to ongoing pregnancy rate is that by transferring a single embryo on day 3 there is a high risk of transferring a chromosomically abnormal embryo though it is of top quality. Whereas, extension of culture to the blastocyst stage allows the best embryos to reach that developmental stage.

Topics will include measures to diminish the impact of non-infectious causes of pregnancy disruption (trauma, heat stress, twinning, plant and other ingested toxins); a few infectious causes where preventive intervention is likely to pay off (e.g. infectious bovine rhinotracheitis (IBR), bovine viral di arrhea (BVD) venereal campylobacteriosis, leptospiro sis); some \"iffy\"areas where the payoff is not as certain; and a discussion of the expectations of a vaccine against any reproductive pathogen. A brief mention will be made of some current thinking on efforts to reduce early preg nancy loss through nutritional management of dairy cows.", "year": 2004, "openAccessPdf": null, "authors": [{"authorId": "1735778693", "name": "R.

First, the basic mechanisms that produce a single ovulation are examined. Follicular deviation is a critical new concept in our understanding of selection of a single dominant follicle. Follicular deviation is characterized by an abrupt deviation in the growth rates between the two largest follicles when the future dominant follicle reaches a diameter of 8.5 \u00b1 1.2 mm (mean and SD). The mechanisms involved in this selection process are not completely defined but appear to involve acquisition of LH receptors on granulosa cells of the dominant follicle, increased estradiol production by the dominant follicle, and inhibition of circulating FSH concentrations. Second, lactation number and milk production were found to be critical epidemiological factors associated with increased ovulation rate and twinning in dairy cattle. Finally, high steroid metabolism is proposed as the critical link between high milk production and double ovulation. It is proposed that high milk production increases steroid metabolism due to increased blood flow to the digestive tract and subsequently to the liver. The liver represents the primary site of steroid metabolism, and blood entering the liver is cleared of steroids. At the time of selection of the dominant follicle, the normal increase in circulating estradiol concentrations and subsequent depression in circulating FSH is blunted due to estradiol metabolism. Thus, FSH remains elevated for a time sufficient to allow follicles to undergo the physiological changes necessary to proceed to ovulation.", "year": 2000, "openAccessPdf": null, "authors": [{"authorId": "5122821", "name": "M.

In one experiment supplements of either 1 or 2 kg of rolled sorghum grain (0.96 per cent N) or 1 kg of soybean meal (8.2 per cent N) per head per day were fed to steers about 18 months of age grazing oats. In the other experiment twin and non-twin weaners (mean age of 13 months) were fed supplements of either molasses plus minerals or molasses plus minerals and urea ad lib. while grazing a winter dormant Rhodes grass pasture. In both experiments the supplemented and unsupplemented groups were randomly allocated to the grazing areas at weekly intervals. Growth rate of the steers in the first experiment was unaffected by either supplement, and it was concluded that the unsupplemented steers reduced their intake of forage by an amount similar to the digestible energy supplied by the supplements. In the second experiment both supplements increased the rate of body weight gain of the weaners, but the error variances were such that significance was reached only for the twins. The growth rate of the twin weaners fed the supplement of molasses plus minerals and urea was significantly (P<0.01) greater than that of the unsupplemented weaners and was also significantly (P<0.05) greater than the growth rate of those given the same amount of molasses plus minerals but without urea. Twins given the molasses plus minerals supplement had a significantly (P<0.05) greater rate of body weight gain than the unsupplemented twin weaners. Calculated returns from feeding grain or soybean meal supplements to steers grazing oats were negative. For weaners grazing Rhodes grass, the molasses plus minerals supplements gave an increase in body weight gain which, on current values, was considerably less than the cost of the molasses, whereas the molasses plus minerals and urea supplement gave a return which was greater than the cost of the molasses plus urea.", "year": 1970, "openAccessPdf": null, "authors": [{"authorId": "144408279", "name": "J.

The \u2018er\u2019 model of embryo survival (McMillan WH et al., 1998 Theriogenology 50, 1053\u20131070) utilizes twin embryo transfer to estimate embryo (\u2018e\u2019) and recipient (\u2018r\u2019) contributions to embryo survival, and allows the comparison of treatment effects without using a control group, when treatment is the only change in operations. Application of the model to data of contemporaneous single and twin transfer indicates that \u2018e\u2019 and \u2018r\u2019 are independent of the number of embryos transferred. Thus, twin transfers enable the efficient use of costly recipients while providing meaningful estimates of single embryo survival rates. The objective of this study was to assess the embryo survival rates of fresh IVP embryos of a newly established IVP lab by applying the model to triple transfers and comparing the expected embryo survival rates with those achieved for single transfers. Cumulus-oocyte complexes (COCs) were aspirated from abattoir-derived ovaries of cows of unknown breeds or by ovum pick-up (OPU) from Holstein-Friesian 2- or 3-yr-old donor cows. COCs were matured in 500\u2009\u03bcL of TCM199\u2009+\u200910% FCS (Life Technologies, Auckland, NZ), 10\u2009\u03bcg\u2009mL\u22121 FSH and LH (ICPBio, Auckland, NZ), 1\u2009\u03bcg\u2009mL\u22121 estradiol (Sigma, Auckland, NZ), 100\u2009\u03bcM cysteamine (Sigma) for 24\u2009h under 5% CO2 and then fertilized with 1\u2009\u00d7\u2009106 percoll-separated sperm mL\u22121 from a single bull (Tervit HR and Pugh PA, 2000 14th ICAR 18, 37(abst)). Twenty-four h after insemination, presumptive zygotes were transferred into 500\u2009\u03bcL mSOF (Pugh A et al., 2001 Theriogenology 55, 314 (abst)) and cultured for 4 days under humidified 5% CO2, 7% O2 and 88% N2. On Day 4, cleaved embryos were transferred into fresh culture medium and culture continued for a further 3 days under the same conditions. Embryo stage and grade were evaluated on Day 7 of culture. Grades 1, 2 and 3 (IETS manual, 2002) compact morulae and blastocysts produced from abattoir-derived COCs were transferred in triplets, while grades 1 and 2 compact morulae and blastocysts from OPU-derived COCs were transferred singly, in 0.25\u2009mL insemination straws into synchronized Holstein-Friesian heifers. Recipients received a CIDR (CIDR Cattle Insert, Pharmacia, Auckland, NZ) at Day \u221212 followed by a prostaglandin (Estroplan, Parnell Laboratories, Auckland, NZ ) injection at Day \u22126. CIDRs were removed at Day \u22122, followed by estrus at Day 0 (= day of IVF). Embryos were transferred on Day 7 and recipients received a CIDR after transfer (ET). CIDRs were removed at Day 19 to synchronize any returns. Two experienced practitioners performed all the transfers. Pregnancies (single transfers) and number of live fetuses (triple transfers) were confirmed at Days 60 and 42, respectively. Pregnancies were terminated between Days 62 and 65 by two prostaglandin injections 48\u2009h apart. A total of 76 single transfers resulted in 36 pregnancies (47.4%, binomial SD 5.7%). A total of 75 triple transfers (225 embryos) resulted in 98 viable fetuses (44%) and 58 pregnant recipients (77.3%). For triple transfers, the estimates for \u2018e\u2019 and \u2018r\u2019 were 0.50 and 0.89, respectively, with the product yielding an expected triple embryo survival rate of 44.1%. The actual distribution of 17, 23, 30 and 5 recipients carrying 0, 1, 2, or 3 fetuses, respectively, was not significantly different from the expected values of 16, 25, 25 and 8 estimated from the model (chi-square\u2009=\u20092.49, NS). Estimates for \u2018e\u2019 and \u2018r\u2019 were not significantly different when combined single and triple data were included in the model (\u2018e\u2019\u2009=\u20090.55 and \u2018r\u2019\u2009=\u20090.90), indicating that embryo survival is independent of the number of embryos transferred. Results indicate that multiple transfers do increase pregnancy rate (from 47.4 to 77.3%), but not embryo survival posttransfer (44.1 v. 47.4%). Although single ET was done with OPU-derived embryos and triple with slaughterhouse-derived embryos and results are not strictly comparable, the similarity of estimates for \u2018e\u2019 suggests that using the same in vitro-embryo assessment criteria resulted in embryos of similar intrinsic viability from the two sources. In the near future, we will perform triple transfers of cryopreserved IVP embryos and use the model to estimate embryo and recipient contributions to embryo survival of frozen IVP embryos, without using a fresh control. We will continue to build a dataset based on triple and single transfers to further assess the effect on embryo survival rates of triple and single transfers.", "year": 2004, "openAccessPdf": {"url": "http://www.publish.csiro.au/rd/pdf/RDv16n1Ab185", "status": "BRONZE"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "88582732", "name": "A.

The sustainability of this pastoral system has been recently questioned, however, as livestock losses, poverty, and food insecurity are increasing. We used rainfall records and herd-history data from 56 pastoral households to characterize cattle population trends on the Borana Plateau during 1980-97. We supplemented these data with other findings to update the record through 1999. We wanted to learn to what extent drought and high stocking rates contribute to the high rates of cattle mortality in recent years. We also wanted to estimate economic losses from cattle deaths. Cattle population dynamics resembled a \u201cboom and bust\u201d pattern where longer periods of gradual herd growth were punctuated by sharp crashes in 1983-5, 1991-2, and 1998-9 when 37 to 62% of the cattle population perished. Cattle losses due to periodic starvation regulated the population\u2014net sales or numbers slaughtered were relatively small. When extrapolated to the entire Borana Plateau, the monetary losses of cattle deaths may have exceeded USD 300 million from 1980 to 1997. Separating out the inter-twined effects of high stocking rates and drought on cattle mortality is difficult. We believe, however, that high stocking rates predispose the system to crash when a dry or drought year happens to occur. The higher the stocking rate and larger the annual rainfall deficit, the larger the crash. In some cases a high stocking rate only needs a slightly dry year to cause a crash. System stability appears to be decreasing because drought grazing reserves are reportedly being lost to cultivation, bush encroachment, insecurity, and over-population. We believe that a cattle crash occurs once every 5 to 6 years because this is the time required for the regional herd to grow to over 20 head per square kilometer, and this increases vulnerability. We thus expect the next cattle crash to occur no earlier than 2005. Capturing some of the wealth lost from cattle mortality is important, but the process is difficult. Development solutions could involve aspects of economic diversification for pastoral households if it is sustainable. Improved risk management could involve more timely livestock sales before crisis occurs and investment of some of the revenue into entrepreneurial ventures or community projects. Such system change requires improvements in education, marketing, and rural financial systems.

I t has been shown further that this power to immunize lies solely in the nuclear material of spleen and kidney cells; it is not found in their cytoplasmic components. The finding that the tissue substances responsible for homologous transplantation immunity are nuclear rather than cytoplasmic is entirely in accord with the well-known lack of tissue specificity both in transplantation immunity and immunological tolerance. For example, adult animals can be immunized against skin homografts by the prior injection of blood leukocytes2 or spleen and kidney cells,3 or by the prior transplantation of whole kidneys4-provided these are derived from the skin donor or animals of the same inbred donor strain. Conversely, the injection of such cells into embryos brings about a state of immunological tolerance of the cell donors' skin grafts in the recipients5 Furthermore, the neonatal injection of mice with spleen cells induces tolerance not only of skin grafts,6 but also of ovarian7 and adrenal8 tissues; and the exchange of blood cells in fetal dizygotic cattle twins leads to tolerance of sking as well as of kidney tissue.1\u00b0 These facts strongly suggested the presence of the same set of transplantation antigens in all the tissues of the body of a single individual, and pointed to the nucleus as the source of the antigenic stimulus long before this could be demonstrated by direct experimental methods. The above considerations do not, however, apply to mammalian red cells: when carefully separated from the blood leukocytes and injected into homologous hosts, they are unable to elicit an immunity which is directed against grafts of skin5, 'I (the fact that other workers have reported very different results with neoplastic l3 has yet to be explained, and has been discussed el~ewhere'~). That mammalian red cells should not possess transplantation antigens is perfectly intelligible in view of the absence of nuclear material in these cells. Avian red cells (which are known to be incapable of inducing immunological tolerance of skin homograf ts6) raise an interesting problem in this connection and await further investigation. The anatomical location of the antigens, their behavior on extraction in water and strong salt solution, their great instability in the face of various physical treatments, and their susceptibility to incubation with deoxyribonuclease but not with ribonuclease or, under certain conditions, with trypsin, all suggest that they may be deoxyribonuclear proteins.' In the mouse these antigens are developed well before birth.

This action results in the following distinctive features of the free-martin gonad: (1) Sterility in consequence of the absence of germ cells. (2) Reduced or completely suppressed ovarial cortex. (3) Hypertrophied medulla with more or less pronounced male type of differentiation. Experiments with amphibians joined in parabiosis at an early embryonic stage were expected to provide possibilities of a detailed analysis of the mechanism of this effect. This hope was rather disappointed, however, when it appeared from the results of Burns' 3 and Witschi's 4 investigations that Amblystoma and Rana behave otherwise than cattle twins and represent two different and new types of reactions. In heterosexual combinations of Amblystoma either one of the sexes may already in the primary sex differentiation assume the absolute leadership, so that pairs of males and pairs of females are obtained exclusively. In frogs, on the other hand, the two sexes first develop independently. Later on the male becomes predominant and causes a regular sex transformation in the female cotwin. The case of Rana comes closer to the cattle type than the case of Amblystoma, because of the finally established dominance of the male sex, however, it differs from it by the accomplishment of perfect sex inversion in the female cotwin. A new group of experiments with the Calif ornian salamander, Triturus torosus, yielded results more nearly comparable with the conditions in cattle. Of twenty-two pairs of twins, joined in parabiosis at the stage immediately preceding the beginning of muscular movements and raised until close to metamorphosis, one half proved to be unisexual (4 and 7 ), while the other half was heterosexual (69 and 5 ).", "year": 1929, "openAccessPdf": null, "authors": [{"authorId": "16788862", "name": "E.

The data consisted of 329,772 lactation records obtained from the Animal Breeding Center of Iran (2003 - 2012) and logistic regression was applied to investigate the associations between the predictor and response variables. The response variable in this experiment was the risk of culling and predictor variables were included calving season, parity, birth type, calving ease, standardized 305-d milk yield, age at the first calving, region and the number of calving cows in the herd. Risk factors analysis showed that the risk of culling significantly (P< 0.001) increased with parity and twinning. The odds ratio of cows leaving the herd were 1.32, 1.55, 1.62, 1.67 and 1.88 for parities 2 to 6, respectively and 1.09 for twinnings.

Calving in hot season increased the risk of culling and cows calved in cool seasons had lower risk of culling. The OR were 0.87, 0.79 and .077 for summer, fall and winter respectively. The analysis showed that region had a significant effect (P< 0.001) on culling risk and cows in warm and dry and warm and semi-arid regions had a higher risk of culling compared the cows in temperate or cold and wet region. Risk of culling significantly (P< 0.001) decreased with increasing in standardized 305-d milk yield so that cows with higher milk yield had the lower risk of culling. Cows at the age first calving about 24 months had the lower risk of culling and with increasing the age at first calving, the risk of culling increased.

In this regard, livestock production has dramatically transformed allowing for efficiency and improvement in productivity. For the past few years, significant improvements in livestock productivity were achieved through the application of different biotechnologies, followed by the extensive uptake of these new techniques. Embryo transfer is the process by which an embryo is collected from the donor and transferred to another recipient to complete the gestation period. The most recent advances are made in the areas of embryo transfer, in vitro fertilization, artificial insemination, cloning, transgenesis and genomics. While some of these applications are still under continues research scale ups. Bovine embryo transfer technology involves the selection and management of donor and recipient animals and the collection and transfer of embryo within a narrow window of time following oestrus. The application of this method is numerous in cattle production to amplify reproductive rates of valuable females, genetic improvement, twining, disease control, planned mating, increased farm income, and others. Because of low reproductive rates and long generation intervals, embryo transfer is especially useful in this species. However, embryo transfer is still not widely used despite its potential benefit. The greatest challenges often associated with this in the developing world are lack of adequate technology due to high cost and technological skills associated with the entire process. Although this technology is not commercially available in developing countries, ET technology could provide opportunities for the conservation and the development of minor breeds.", "year": 2020, "openAccessPdf": null, "authors": [{"authorId": "1659177562", "name": "Biruh Mebratu"}]}

The study aimed to identify SNPs on Indonesian cattle breeds and analyze their genetic diversity using Bovine 50K SNP chip. Twenty eight \"Ongole Grade\" (OG) beef cattle and 20 \"Holstein Friesian\" (HF) dairy cattle were used for the Infinium II assay test. This assay included amplification of genomic DNA, fragmentation, precipitation, resuspension, hybridization, processing bead chip for single-base extension, and imaging at iScan. Data and clusters were analyzed using GenomeStudio software. The Bovine 50K SNP chip containing 54,609 SNPs was observed spanning all chromosomes of bovine genome. Genotyping for the total SNPs was successfull based on Call Rate, GeneCall and GeneTrain scores. Most SNP markers had alleles that shared among the individuals or breeds, or had specific alleles at distinctive frequencies. Minor allele frequency (MAF) spreads equally with intervals of 0-0.5. The breeds of OG and HF tended to be separated in different clusters without considering their genetic history and twin or normal. This result suggests that most individuals are closely related to one another, regardless of the same breed. Some genes identified on chromosomes 3, 4, 5, 7, 13, 17 and 18 were located in the loci/regions that contained SNPs with specific alleles of either HF or OG breed. These SNPs were more powerful for differentiation of beef cattle and dairy cattle than among individuals in the same breed. These SNP variations and genetic relatedness among individuals and breeds serve basic information for cattle breeding in Indonesia.

The objective of the study was to estimate the heritability of twin calving rate in herds with a high phenotypic mean for non\u2010identical twin calving. The annual twin calving rate of the private herds averaged 3.36% overall, based on a total of 17 474 calving records. On average, there were 13% of cows from the selected herds with at least one twin calving in their lifetime.

The etiology of this disease, in a partially solved state, supported the importance of mutagenic agents, physical and chemical ones, upon the mother, especially during the early phases of embryo development, as a determining factor in causing such abnormalities. Although this theory has been proven viable to a certain degree, recent studies tend to attribute the disease etiology to the abnormal activity of the SHH protein. The purpose of this study is to highlight the various ways that diprosopus can manifest itself in different species, including mankind, while also searching for a model that can explain both its origins and its incidence. Throughout this research 7 cases are presented, which detail the main characteristics of Diprosopus, in different species, while also highlighting findings achieved through multiple techniques, such as histological, radiological and necropsy exams, establishing a clear distinction between it and similar abnormalities.", "year": 2017, "openAccessPdf": null, "authors": [{"authorId": "46180056", "name": "V.

They are dwarf in size and noted to be famous for their adaptability, fertility, prolificacy, delicacy of meat and superior skin quality (Husain et al. 1996). It is well adapted to hot and humid climate and usually produces twins and triplets. However, it has been observed that there exists sizeable genetic variation with the traits between individuals within and between locations (Amin et al. 2000). These variations can be exploited for genetic improvement using selective breeding within the breed (Husain et al. 1996; Akhter et al. 2000). But it is a matter of great concern that unlike cattle, goat raisers castrate almost all of their male kids at their early age. Consequently, availability of breeding bucks become squeezed day by day (Amin, 1999). Therefore, provision of Artificial Insemination (AI) using selected buck semen is the easiest Semen from six adult male Black Bengal goats (Capra hircus) was collected to compare the fresh and frozen-thawed semen quality and investigate its relationship with the fertility. Each collected samples was divided into two parts: One part of semen was used as fresh and another part was filled into 0.50 ml straws, sealed, cooled (5 \u030aC) and equilibrated for freezing. In both cases, semen was diluted with commercial Triladyl diluent (a Tris based diluter). The motility and morphology of fresh and frozen-thawed semen was subjectively evaluated by one operator. It was revealed that motility and sperm abnormality of the frozen semen differed significantly (P<0.05), but differed insignificantly in fresh semen between males. Besides these, fresh and frozen-thawed sperm motilities also differed significantly (P<0.01) between males which varied from 70.83\u00b11.54 to 74.23\u00b11.59% and 44.17\u00b12.39 to 52.31\u00b11.08%, respectively. A significantly (P<0.01) higher sperm abnormalities was observed in frozen-thawed semen (11.18\u00b10.42 to 16.55\u00b10.09%) than that of fresh semen (8.82\u00b10.24 to 9.71\u00b10.52%). Cervical inseminations were performed with fresh and frozen-thawed semen in 997 and 1004 female goats, respectively, both at Nucleus Breeding Flock (NBF) and four project areas. Fresh semen showed significantly (P<0.01) higher kidding rates (59.8%) than that with frozen-thawed semen (43.9%). The motilities of fresh and frozen-thawed semen were positively correlated (0.526 and 0.987; P<0.01), whereas the proportion of morphologically abnormal spermatozoa was negatively correlated (-0.530 and -0.776) with fertility of Black Bengal goats. Males with a higher motility and lower proportion of abnormal spermatozoa provided better fertility.", "year": 2012, "openAccessPdf": null, "authors": []}

None of the cows showed clinical signs of illness following exposure, but all had seroconverted within six weeks. Six fetuses, including one set of twins, died in utero following infection.

A study was made over three consecutive spring seasons on the effect of potassium fertilisation of pasture on the development of hypomagnesaemia in lactating ewes. No effect was found in the first two years but where the potassium fertiliser was applied for the third successive year, significant depressions in the mean plasma magnesium concentration of ewes grazing thereon were found. Studies were also made into the effects of age, breed and number of suckled lambs on the development of hypomagnesaemia in Sheep. Age was found to have little influence. The suckling of either single or twin lambs was found to have no effect in one experiment but in a second trial, a greater incidence of hypomagnesaemia was demonstrated in ewes with twin lambs. Differences were found between two breeds of sheep in their relative susceptibility to hypomagnesaemia. Highly significant correlations were demonstrated between the plasma magnesium concentrations of individual ewes in consecutive years. By collation of existing literature reports, it was demonstrated that 80 - 90% of reported olinical cases in castle and sheep had a concomitant hypomagnesaemia and hypocaloaemis. The hypomagnesaemia was shown to develop rapidly over the 24 hours proceding the appearance of clinical signs. An experiment is described where an attempt was made to reproduce this situation of hypomagnesaemia in combination with hypomagnesaemia. No clinical cases were recorded. Studies were made with sheep to assess the value of existing prophylactic measures which are recommended for hypomagnesaemic tetany. The daily administration of magnesium salts, containing 4 g. magnesium, to sheep was found to produce only a small temporary response in the plasma magnesium concentration and this response was not maintained over a 24 hour period. A pasture application of 5 owts of oalcined magnesite per acre produced significant increases in the plasma magnesium concentration of grazing sheep. There was no response from the use only 0.5 owts/acre, when applied as a fertiliser in the winter, but this quantity, when applied as a pasture dust, inoreased the plasma magnesium concentration of sheep grasing thereon. As a possible new method of prophylaxis, a rumen pellet, containing a metal magneaium/aluminium alloy, was developed, this pellet was shown to corrode in the rumeno-reticular sac at a regular rate over a period of sir to eight weeks. Seven trials were carried out on sir farms to test the efficiency of a treatment of magnesium rumen pellets as a prophylactic measure for hypomagnesaemic tetany in cattle, sheep and oalves. In a total of 181 animals given this treatment, there were no olinical cases of tetany, whereas in a similar number of comparable control animals, there were six cases of hypomagnesaemic tetany. A response to treatment in the mean plasma magnesium levels was also demonstrated in five of the seven trails.", "year": 1966, "openAccessPdf": null, "authors": [{"authorId": "8350042", "name": "N.

In addition other techniques can be developed, such as sexing and bipartition of embryos. An alternative to improve the economic viability of ET in cattle would be to bipartition embryos in order to increase the yield of the technique. The aim of this study was to investigate the operational viability of embryo bipartition technique in an ET program in cattle and to study aspects related to the viability and development of bovine hemi-embryos (HE) compared with intact ones. The embryos were collected by nonsurgical technique 7 days after the onset of oestrus. Viable structures (130) from 49 embryo collections from 25 Aberdeen and Simmental donor cows and heifers were used. Only embryos in compact morula, early blastocyst and blastocyst stage, with a morphological range from excellent to good grade (IETS Grade 1), were split. The embryos, split (78) or not (52), were transferred into the uterine horn ipsilateral to the corpus luteum of the recipients 7 days after oestrus. The treatment groups evaluated were T1 (intact embryo, n\u2009=\u200952), T2 (1 HE, n\u2009=\u200927) and T3 (2 HE, n\u2009=\u200951). Crossbred heifers were used as recipients and pregnancy diagnosis was done at 60 to 80 days of gestation. The embryos of T1, T2 and T3 were classified morphologically as excellent or good and by developmental stage as morula, early blastocyst, or blastocyst, distributed as follows: T1: 30, 22 and 16, 17 and 19; T2: 15, 12 and 7, 9 and 11; and T3: 29, 22 and 15, 15 and 21, respectively. The birth rate per original embryos was greater for T2 than for T1 and T3 (Table 1). The pregnancy rates for excellent and good embryos and morulae, early blastocysts and blastocysts were not different (P\u2009>\u20090.05). The T1, T2 and T3 twin births were 0, 1 and 5, respectively.

PROCEEDINGS 31ST AEDEAN CONFERENCE 890 women and nature, based on the shared experience of oppression and domination. Like feminism, ecofeminism did not originate within the field of literary studies, but within the ground of political activism. The interpenetration that ecofeminist activists had been observing between ecology and feminism through the 70s and 80s only rarely found an echo among feminist literary scholars. From the 90s on, however, ecofeminism has definitely found its place within literary criticism. As indicated by its name, ecofeminism is a branch of both ecocriticism and feminist studies, devoted originally to analyse how the oppression women are subjected to in patriarchal societies mirrors that exerted on the natural world by human beings. As Ynestra King notes: \u201cThe hatred of women and the hatred of nature are intimately connected and mutually reinforcing\u201d (1983: 118). Ecofeminists highlight the conceptual connection between the domination of women and the domination of nature as being located in an oppressive and patriarchal conceptual framework characterized by a logic of domination. Lately, however, building on both ecocritic and feminist challenging of the dichotomy of absolute difference, ecofeminism has evolved into a wider critical movement that extends the interconnections between the domination of nature and the oppression of women, to include the subjugation of any representative of the \u201cOther\u201d. \u201cEcological feminism\u201d is an umbrella term which captures a variety of multicultural perspectives on the nature of the connections within social systems of domination between those humans in subdominant or subordinate positions, particularly women, and the domination of nonhuman nature. ... Ecofeminist analyses of the twin domination of women and nature include considerations of the domination of people of color, children, and the underclass. (Warren, 1994: 1) In order to illustrate some of these concepts and how they can be used in textual analysis, we will briefly present three specific examples of ecofeminst readings of three novels and the photographs of an environmentalist campaign. CARMEN FLYS JUNQUERA, MARGARITA CARRETERO GONZ\u00c1LEZ, DIANA VILLANUEVA ROMERO, IMELDA MART\u00cdN JUNQUERA AND IRENE SANZ ALONSO 891 1. An ecofeminist approach to the situation of Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez through literary texts Ecofeminists have brought to attention the increasing problem of abuses towards women of color and why women are preferred as workers to men in maquiladora plants in Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez; their oppression gets \u201cjustified by natural fact\u201d, as Legler (1997: 231) argues. Thus, more women are employed at the maquiladora industry because their hands are smaller and more skilled for working with precision at assembly lines; therefore, the industry increases productivity at the same time that saves money by paying them lower wages. They are still second class citizens suffering the arm of patriarchy which confers more dignity to men\u2019s jobs. Desert Blood: The Juarez Murders by Alicia Gaspar de Alba pays a tribute to all those anonymous \u201cmuchachas del sur\u201d abused and murdered while searching to fulfil their dreams. Ana Castillo and Alicia Gaspar de Alba coincide in deliberately introducing the characters of So Far from God and Desert Blood as gendered bodies. Sofia and Ivon, correspondingly, represent the strong characters, empowered women, the non abused bodies called to restore order and avoid the supremacy of patriarchy which oppresses the protagonists of both novels. It is not unintentional that these novels show lesbian characters as well as sexually abused ones. In fact, Castillo and Gaspar de Alba\u2019s women of colour face environmental racism in several forms because of the intersection of variables such as sex, gender, class and ethnicity. Both Chicana writers denounce the abuse and exploitation to which women from minorities are subjected. In So Far From God, Fe, the most conservative of the sisters, suffers a miscarriage. Certainly, Fe had grown up dreaming to become a wife and a mother: she marries her cousin and finds a job in a factory where she works isolated, wearing gloves and manipulating chemical products. Being so good at utilization and efficiency, the queen of it, you could say that, at ACME International, she was on to bigger jobs and better pay in no time. She worked hard no matter what, PROCEEDINGS 31ST AEDEAN CONFERENCE 892 even though, for instance, she did not like the last cleaning job she was given. It\u2019s not like she had complained about it or nothing, but three months of working with a chemical that actually glowed in the dark and therefore you could work with it in the dark, with special gloves and cap (and why you did, as a supervisor explained was to be able to detect if any fingerprints or hair got on the parts) was this red ring around her nose and breath that smelled suspiciously as glue. (Castillo, 1998: 181) Unaware of the fact that she is making chemical weapons for mass destruction at ACME, Fe dismisses the signs of intoxication her body sends to her; one of the symptoms is her miscarriage, something which had become common for many of the women working at ACME. Left barren first, she later develops cancer and dies of toxic exposure. Fe\u2019s death shows the reader the ulterior purpose of the factory: the chemicals are designed to kill individuals. From an ecofeminist perspective, these factories consciously use women, closer to animals, thus inferior human beings, as Castillo illustrates with the image of the red ring on Fe\u2019s nose. The ring somehow evokes cattle being marked and transported from place to place. A similar situation is found in Desert Blood: The Juarez Murders where young women working in assembly lines in maquiladora plants keep disappearing and turn up dead in the middle of the desert after they have been brutally raped and butchered as animals for the sole purpose of producing pleasure: \u2018Where is the bitch? I want to see the bitch now!\u2019 She\u2019s terrified that they\u2019re coming for her and feels her bowels contract. \u2018Here comes the lucky penny\u2019 [...] \u2018Fuck the shit out of her, man. Camera Two, keep tight on that prick. Camera One, body shot from behind. That\u2019s it. Hump the little bitch. I want to see some spunk in one minute.\u2019 \u2018Okay, Dracula, do your thing, man. Let\u2019s spend the lucky penny.\u2019 (Gaspar de Alba, 2005: 267\u2013268) CARMEN FLYS JUNQUERA, MARGARITA CARRETERO GONZ\u00c1LEZ, DIANA VILLANUEVA ROMERO, IMELDA MART\u00cdN JUNQUERA AND IRENE SANZ ALONSO 893 These women are expendable bodies, as well as the rest of the women working at ACME. They can easily be replaced for others eager to prosper since young women arrive every day in Ju\u00e1rez aiming to improve their living conditions. The claim to save the earth should definitely include a cry to protect women and especially women of color whose lives experience constant threats from the First World: \u201cSaving people should be as important as saving trees. In addition, it is noteworthy that the people that are targeted as expendable are people of color or Third World people who have the least institutional power or access to resources in society\u201d (Smith, 1997: 25\u201326). Gaspar de Alba chooses Cecilia, a pregnant woman from a maquiladora plant, to show the abuse and exploitation female workers are subject to in Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez. She is found dead and the autopsy reveals that she was impregnated at work, as part of an experiment, by the so called Egyptian chemist: Well, yeah, all of them had to take a pregnancy test, but apparently, there were some he chose to test for something else. He made her take saliva samples, not just urine samples, and he gave them pap smears himself. She had to keep meticulous charts about their periods and ovulation cycles. I guess he thought she was stupid and didn\u2019t know that he was doing sexual things to these girls during their physicals.\u201d (Gaspar de Alba, 2005: 96) Within the same sphere of abuse inflicted on female bodies, of using women as test objects, another concern of ecofeminist criticism, clearly illustrated in these two novels is the fight for reproductive rights: \u201cWomen of color, in fact, do not get choices regarding our reproductive health. In the efforts to stabilize our population, we are constantly subjected to unsafe drug testing or forced sterilization\u201d (Smith, 1997: 28). The struggle for reproductive rights is incomplete without an antiracist, anticolonialist analysis. Imperialist, colonialist attitudes oppress even more women of colour.

The electrocauterization of follicles on day 16 delayed luteolysis and did not reduce variability. The injection of 1 000 i.u. of PMSG on day 3 post-cestrus produced 35.7 p. 100 of twin ovulations when 600 i.u. were injected on day 16. Another explanation of response variability is the duration of PMSG action which can be modified by controlling the PMSG-oestrus interval with prostaglandin analogs; lenghtening that interval increased the ovulation rates from 1.75 to 4.60 and decreased the number of large follicles growing after ovulation from 5.13 to 0.60.

Prevalence and cow- and herd-level risk factors associated with ovulation rate were determined using 40,617 ultrasonographic records of the reproductive tract from 27,907 dairy and beef cows from 738 commercial herds. Prevalence of twin births was estimated from the Irish national database containing 23,658,351 calving events from 8,546,695 cows from 125,251 dairy and beef herds; factors associated with twin births were determined using a random subsample of 505,200 calving events from 280,638 cows in 81,329 herds. The mean prevalence of multiple ovulations was 6.83% while the prevalence of twin births was 1.74%. Occurrence of both multiple ovulations and twin births was associated with the month of scan (P < 0.0001) and month of calving (P < 0.0001), respectively, and peaked in November for multiple ovulations and October for twin births. The likelihood of multiple ovulations increased with interval postpartum and peaked between 45 to 185 d postcalving, after which the likelihood declined. The likelihood of both multiple ovulations (P < 0.0001) and twin births (P < 0.0001) increased with increasing cow parity. A greater proportion of Holstein, Friesian, Simmental, Hereford, and Charolais breed fractions were associated with a greater likelihood of multiple ovulations. There was no difference between breed proportion of the cow and incidence of twin births, where all breed proportions examined, litter difference existed among breeds in their association with risk of twin births. Although multiple ovulations were lowly heritable (0.028 \u00b1 0.003), their occurrence was repeatable (0.326 \u00b1 0.342) while twin birth rate in cattle was lowly heritable (0.017 \u00b1 0.004) and repeatable (0.018 \u00b1 0.011).

This phenomenon plays a critical role in embryogenesis and development. The epigenetic modification of the genome involves methylation changes and the remodeling of chromatin-associated proteins (Li 2002). Imprints are established during the development of germ cells, and the reprogramming of imprinting occurs within the first days after fertilization (Reik and Walter 2001). The alteration of normal imprinting patterns is implicated in a number of human genetic diseases. Among them, the Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome (BWS [MIM 130650]) is an overgrowth syndrome secondary to the dysregulation of the imprinted 11p15 region (Maher and Reik 2000). Numerous mechanisms are involved in BWS, and \u223c70% of cases of BWS are related to epigenetic abnormalities at the 11p15 locus, mostly demethylation of the KvDMR1 region of the KCNQ1OT (previously called \u201cLIT1\u201d) gene (MIM 604115) (Engel et al. 2000; Bliek et al. 2001; Gaston et al. 2001; Weksberg et al. 2001; DeBaun et al. 2002). KCNQ1OT encodes a noncoding antisense transcript within intron 10 of the KCNQ1 gene (MIM 192500) (Lee et al. 1999; Mitsuya et al. 1999; Smilinich et al. 1999) and might be involved in the regulation of parental imprinting of the centromeric domain of the 11p15 region (Fitzpatrick et al. 2002). \n \nIn sheep and cattle, epigenetic abnormalities have been shown to be involved in large offspring syndrome (LOS) (Young et al. 1998). Affected animals exhibit various phenotypes, including large size at birth. In both species, the syndrome is caused by the in vitro exposure of embryos, between fertilization and the blastocyst stage, to various unusual environments. LOS is related to the loss of imprinting of the IGF2 receptor gene (MIM 147280), which ensures internalization and degradation of IGF2 and displays an antiproliferative function (Young et al. 2001). In vitro preimplantation procedures in mice are also responsible for overgrowth, owing to the abnormal expression of various imprinted genes, particularly the genes located at distal chromosome 7 (h19 [MIM 103280] and igf2 [MIM 147470] genes), orthologous to the human 11p15 region (Humpherys et al. 2001; Rideout et al. 2001). In humans, a case of BWS was recently described after in vitro fertilization (IVF) (Olivennes et al. 2001). Moreover, two recent papers (DeBaun et al. 2003; Maher et al. 2003) described an increase in prevalence of assisted reproductive technologies (ART) in patients with BWS. De Baun et al. (2003) reported a sixfold increase (4.6% vs. 0.76% in the general population) and showed that four of the six patients for whom DNA was available exhibited an isolated demethylation of KvDMR1 in the KCNQ1OT gene. Maher et al. (2003) reported a threefold increase (4% vs. 0.997% in the general population) and demonstrated that two of the six patients on whom molecular analysis could be done also exhibited an isolated demethylation of KvDMR1. \n \nOur department is a reference center in France for molecular diagnosis of BWS, and patients are referred from various medical departments (neonatology, pediatrics, genetics, and fetopathology). We studied a series of 149 patients referred for overgrowth syndromes and diagnosed as BWS, since all of them exhibited genetic or epigenetic defects at the 11p15 locus. According to the inclusion criteria described elsewhere (Gaston et al. 2001), 102 patients exhibited a complete form of BWS, and 47 exhibited an incomplete form of BWS. The techniques used to analyze the 11p15 region have been described elsewhere (Gaston et al. 2000, 2001). Epigenetic changes concerned 104 (70%) patients, most of whom (n=90) exhibited a loss of KvDMR1 methylation. Fourteen patients (9.4%) exhibited isolated hypermethylation of the H19 gene. Forty-two patients exhibited a genetic defect: 11p15 uniparental disomy (n=35; 23.5%) and germline CDKN1C (MIM 600856) mutation (n=7; 4.7%). Three patients (2%) had a chromosomal abnormality. \n \nSix of the 149 patients were born following ART. Of note, these six patients exhibited the same epigenetic abnormality (isolated demethylation of KvDMR1 with a demethylation index varying 72%\u2013100%) (fig. 1). All of them were sporadic cases, and one was a DZ twin. The clinical features of these patients and the procedures of ART used for their conception are summarized in table 1. As shown in table 1, the phenotypes of patients born after ART were not different from phenotypes of the other patients (n=84) with isolated demethylation of KVDMR1, with the exception that only one patient born after ART exhibited ear abnormalities. These children were issued from various ART procedures: classical IVF, intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI), embryo freezing, and transfer on day 2, day 3, and day 5. More recent procedures, like ICSI (two of six patients) or blastocyst transfer (one of six patients), did not prevail over other techniques. The representation of ART (4%) in our series is three times higher than that in the general population (1.3%), according to the national report of the French Ministry of Health (9,930 of 770,000 live births resulting in 1,999 from IVF, ICSI, or frozen embryo transfer). On the basis of this report, we would have expected 1.94 of the 149 patients with BWS to be born as a result of ART. To test the significance of this difference of frequencies, we used the Fisher\u2019s exact test (P=.01) as well as the Poisson approximation (two-tailed P=.018; 95% CI 1.5\u20138.7). Strength of the association between exposure to ART and risk of BWS is expressed by an odds ratio of 3.2 (95% CI 1.4\u20137.3). This rate is the same as that described by Maher et al. (2003) but lower than that described by DeBaun et al. (2003), which addressed a prospective study. In our series and in Maher\u2019s series, this rate is probably underestimated, as specific questions regarding ART have only been asked systematically in the past year. \n \n \n \nFigure 1 \n \nMethylation analysis of KvDMR1 in liver tissue (patient 131) and leukocytes (patients 15, 94, 98, 115, and 137) from the six patients with BWS born after ART and in leukocytes from a normal control (C). Genomic DNA was digested with BamHI and the methylation-sensitive ... \n \n \n \n \n \nTable 1 \n \nClinical Characteristics of the Six Patients with BWS Born Following ART \n \n \n \nAlthough the analysis of the imprinting status at chromosome 15q11-13 in children born after ICSI did not reveal an imprinting defect (Manning et al. 2000), two recent papers reported three patients with Angelman syndrome (MIM 105830) born after ICSI (Cox et al. 2002; Orstavik et al. 2002). All three patients exhibited an imprinting defect, which is a rare cause of Angelman syndrome. \n \nAs in the previous two reports (DeBaun et al. 2003; Maher et al. 2003), our data suggest that ART may favor imprinting alterations at the centromeric imprinted 11p15 locus and, consequently, the incidence of BWS. These data highlight the need to carefully follow up children born after ART to test for BWS and other diseases related to imprinted regions. Although no specific procedures of ART appear to be associated with a risk of BWS in our series, these data lend support to the importance of precisely recording these different procedures of ART, particularly the stimulation protocol, the biological technique, the stage of maturation of the gametes, the culture media used at each step, and the timing of embryo transfer.", "year": 2003, "openAccessPdf": {"url": "http://www.cell.com/article/S0002929707606636/pdf", "status": "HYBRID"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2133512", "name": "C.

These sex ratios cannot be affected by manipulating the environment after fertilization except that in some frogs Amblystomes and in Pleurodeles watlii sex hormones can affect the results obtained by altering the K/Ca + Mg ratio. In rats the proportion of males was increased to 58.3% by feeding female lactose diets (high calcium) compared to others fed a starch (rachitic) diet who produced 43.1% males.

Interestingly, freemartins sometimes develop highly masculinized gonads with seminiferous tubule-like structures despite the absence of SRY. However, in these cases, the degree of masculinization in each gonadal somatic cell type is unclear. Here, we report a rare case of a freemartin Japanese black calf with almost complete XX sexreversal. Gross anatomical analysis of this calf revealed the presence of a pair of small testis-like gonads with rudimentary epididymides, in addition to highly masculinized genitalia including a pampiniform plexus, scrotum and vesicular gland. Histological and immunohistochemical analyses of these masculinized gonads revealed well-defined seminiferous tubule-like structures throughout the whole gonadal parenchyma. In epithelia of these tubules, SOX9-positive supporting cells (i.e., Sertoli cells) were found to be arranged regularly along the bases of tubules, and they were also positive for GDNF, one of the major factors for spermatogenesis. 3\u03b2-HSD-positive cells (i.e., Leydig cells) and SMA-positive peritubular myoid cells were also identified around tubules. Therefore, for the first time, we found the transdifferentiation of ovarian somatic cells into all testicular somatic cell types in the XX freemartin gonads. These data strongly support the idea of a high sexual plasticity in the ovarian somatic cells of mammalian gonads.", "year": 2012, "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/jrd/58/6/58_2012-070/_pdf", "status": "GOLD"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "4872215", "name": "Kyoko Harikae"}, {"authorId": "3844886", "name": "N.

Little information on the fate of dead twins has been published. Practitioners usually apply a therapeutic abortion using prostaglandin F2\u03b1 (PGF2\u03b1) or its analogs to reduce the associated extended interval to estrus. This study evaluated the dose\u2013response effect of PGF2\u03b1 inducing abortion in cows with two dead twins at pregnancy diagnosis 28\u201334 days post-AI (late embryonic period) or at confirmation of pregnancy 49\u201355 days post-AI (early fetal period). An increased PGF2\u03b1 dose had no influence on the induction of abortion and the induced abortion rate was inversely associated with milk production during the late embryonic period, whereas an increased PGF2\u03b1 dose was found to offer improvements during the early fetal period. Abstract This study examined the dose\u2013response effect of prostaglandin F2\u03b1 (PGF2\u03b1) when used to induce abortion in cows with two dead twins at pregnancy diagnosis 28\u201334 days post-AI (late embryonic period: LE) or at pregnancy confirmation 49\u201355 days post-AI (early fetal period: EF). The study population consisted of 415 cows receiving a single PGF2\u03b1 dose (PG1 group: 254 LE and 161 EF cows) and 200 receiving a 1.5 \u00d7 PGF2\u03b1 dose (PG1.5 group: 121 LE and 79 EF cows). The induced abortion rate was significantly lower (chi-square test; p < 0.0001) in the EF (34.6%) than LE cows (88%), and was also reduced (p = 0.001) in the EF PG1 group (28%) compared with the EF PG1.5 group (48.1%). High milk production (\u226545 kg) was the only factor influencing the induced abortion rate in LE cows (odds ratio 0.2; p < 0.0001), whereas the odds ratio for induced abortion of PG1.5 cows was 2.3 (p = 0.005) in EF cows. In conclusion, an increased PGF2\u03b1 dose had no effect on abortion induction during the late embryonic period and its rate was inversely associated with milk production. This higher PGF2\u03b1 dose did, however, offer benefits during the early fetal period.", "year": 2021, "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://www.mdpi.com/2076-2615/11/9/2508/pdf", "status": "GOLD"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "1398071649", "name": "F.

Twinning in monotocous domestic species dairy cattle is most frequently by dizygote in which two eggs is ovulated by treatment with gonadotrophin hormone. A study to see the effect of concentration of Follicle Stimulating Hormone (Folltropin) on ovulation rate and twin birth was conducted. The experiment design was Completely Randomized Designed with 3 treatments of total concentration of FSH (A: 12, B: 6 and C 3 ml) and 4 lactating cows for a replications. Hormone was intramuscularly injected in decreasing doses method twice a day with 12 hours apart for 4 days. Data recorded was diameter of ovary (DO), total corpus lutheum (TCL), concentration of progesterone on the day 12 of estrus cycle (P), percentage of pregnancy and birth rate. FSH significantly increased the ovulation rate. The means of DO was significantly (P < 0.05) higher after injection (6.3 cm) than those before injection (2.0 cm). The TCL and P were highly significant (P < 0.01) higher after injection. The TCL and P were 1.2 and 0.8 ng/ml and 8.5 and 3.0 ng/ml before and after hormone treatment respectively.

Retained placenta is failure of the placenta to be expelled within 6-24 hours post calving. Such retention creates a number of problems by allowing microorganisms to grow inside the uterus causing inflammation, fever, decreased milk yield, and longer calving intervals. The prevalence of RFM appears to be varying from country to country or place to place, year to year and breed to breed. Potential risk factors for retention of placenta include infectious diseases, managemental system, nutrition, hereditary, hormonal, maternal immune system, twining, cow\u2019s body weight, calves\u2019 birth weight, age, and parity. Cows with retained placenta are reported have higher incidence of metritis and lower conception rates. The economic losses due to retained placenta in dairy cattle existed as a consequence of longer calving interval, delayed post-delivery service interval, reduced conception rate, infertility, loss of milk production, the costs of veterinary service and drugs. Commonly used hormone in treating RFM is prostaglandins and oxytocin. Systemic use of antibiotics is believed to be beneficial in RFM cases where fever is present. Current evidence does not support manual removal as an effective treatment for RFM. The control of retained placenta needs to focus on the control of causative factors. Approaches to prevent occurrence of RFM in cattle include cow comfort, proper immunization and careful nutritional management (mineral supplementation), particularly during the transition period.", "year": 2016, "openAccessPdf": null, "authors": [{"authorId": "152969441", "name": "J.

Another ancient conception of mixed blood, once considered of fundamental importance but now regarded as equally mythical, was that attributed to the offspring of caste, or racial intermarriages. In 1945 Owen created a new scientific interest in the \u2018blood chimaeras\u2019 by showing serologically that in cattle there was usually an admixture of blood elements in dizygotic twins. This finding had been anticipated by Lillie in 1917, when he established that the genital abnormalities and sterility of the freemartin were due to ovarian inhibition by male hormones reaching the female twin by way of a placental anastomosis. Contrary to expectations a similar mixing, resulting in a double blood group, was demonstrated by Dunsford, Bowley, Hutchison, Thompson, Sanger and Race in 1953 in the survivor (Mrs. McK.) of dissimilar human twins. This finding suggested very strongly that the placentae of these binovular (dizygotic) twins must have united at an early stage in embryonic development, alloying the exchange and subsequent grafting of haemopoietic elements. Originally, only the red-cell antigens and the blood-group antibodies were investigated, but shortly after the publication of the method of determining the \u2018genetic sex\u2019 from the neutrophl leucocytes (Davidson and Smith, 1954), Dr. Race, one of the authors, suggested investigating the leucocytes in this case. In the blood films there were undoubted sex-characteristic \u2018drumsticks\u2019 in the neutrophils, as would be anticipated in a female, but they were rather infrequent. In the past year the opportunity to examine blood films from two further pairs of twins showing a similar chimaerism, Mr. W. and Miss W. (Booth et al., 1957) and Mr. G. and Mrs. Wh. (Nicholas, Jenkins and Marsh, 1957), has provided more complete information regarding the neutrophils. Drumsticks have been found in the neutrophils of the males as well as of the females, confirming the admixture of bloods. The number of neutrophils per drumstick, when related to that anticipated from a survey of a large series of \u2018normal\u2019 women, gives further support to this view. Recently, we have applied the method of neutrophil sexing to the study of artificial chimaeras and have used it in rabbits to follow the success of marrow grafting after total-body irradiation.", "year": 1958, "openAccessPdf": null, "authors": [{"authorId": "37316698", "name": "W.

This condition has been given many names, but all writers describe a complex of multiple joint contractures and defective muscles, with normal sensation, present at birth. The literature on arthrogryposis and the clinical course of these patients have been reviewed in an attempt to learn more about the condition and its orthopaedic management. Inheritance seems an unlikely factor because a family history of arthrogryposis is uncommon. Yet Pearson and Fowler (1963) reported two siblings involved, Laitinen and Hirvensalo (1966) a family of four affected siblings, and Lipton and Morgenstern (1955) affected identical twins. Roberts (1929) described an arthrogryposis-like condition in sheep transmitted in an autosomal recessive pattern. Hillman and Johnson (1952) described two pairs of identical twins of which only one in each pair had arthrogryposis, which ruled out a genetic factor in his cases. Some authors have suggested that mechanical obstruction to intra-uterine foetal movement might produce deformity (Stern 1923, Lewin 1925, Brandt 1947). Increased intra-uterine pressure, hydramnios, oligohydramnios and foetal malposition have been blamed. Viral infections of the central nervous system have been incriminated (Whittem 1957, Drachman and Banker 1961), but we found only one report of clear-cut chronic inflammatory changes in tissues of the central nervous system, and then only in the meninges overlying the spinal cord in a baby offour and a halfmonths (Price 1933). Toxins have not been identified as the cause of human arthrogryposis, but Whittem (1957) mentioned chronic cyanide intoxication and ergotism in cattle as producing deformities in calves. Degenerative changes in muscle or anterior horn cells have been held responsible for the deformities. Middleton (1934) interpreted the changes in human and sheep arthrogrypotic muscle as a primary degenerative process in ulero analogous to the human dystrophies of later life. Banker, Victor and Adams (1957) also described two patients with primary degeneration of skeletal muscle, and extensive fatty degeneration of affected muscle has been found at necropsy (Howard 1908). Several investigators have found diminution of anterior horn cells, and occasionally disturbed cortical fissuring and enlargement of the cerebral ventricles organic cerebral lesions in four of his eight cases.

METHODS: Cows (n=690) from spring-calving dairy herds (n=22) were enrolled in a prospective case-control study if they had a history of dystocia, a dead calf at calving or within 24 h of calving, retained foetal membranes (RFM), metabolic disease, twins or a vulval discharge >13 days postpartum. Cows were blocked by age, periparturient condition and calving date, and randomly assigned to be either treated with 0.5 g of cephapirin by intrauterine infusion, or left as untreated controls. Treatment occurred 24\u201342 days before the planned start of mating (PSM) within each herd. In addition, the reproductive tracts of 91 cows from 4 herds were examined using a vaginal speculum and rectal palpation and cervical-os discharge was scored on a scale from 0 (nil) to 3 (purulent). RESULTS: Overall, more treated cows were retained in the trial herds until pregnancy testing than control cows (p<0.05). Average 28-day submission rate was higher (93.1% vs 87.1%; p<0.05) and PSM-to-first-service interval was shorter (9 \u00b1 1 vs 11 \u00b1 1 days; p<0.05) in treated than control cows. The percentage of cows not pregnant at the end of the mating period was not affected by treatment overall. However, amongst cows diagnosed with RFM, a dead calf, or vulval discharge, pregnancy rates 28 and 56 days after PSM were higher for treated than control cows (p<0.05). Cows with a purulent cervical-os discharge had lower 28-day submission rates (p<0.01), lower 28-day pregnancy rates (p<0.05) and higher non-pregnant rates at the end of mating than cows with nil or mucoid cervical-os discharges.

CLONAL ORIGIN OF MELANOCYTES*", "abstract": "In higher organisms, the cells of an individual become greatly diversified despite their identity of genotype. How such diversification is achieved and how supracellular organization then comes about have remained largely obscure. A new way of getting at these questions was formulated in this laboratory; its purpose was to subject the pivotal genotype-phenotype relationship to experimental manipulation. The intact organism was taken to be the necessary framework for such an experimental study of gene expression, and the mouse, with its wide variety of available genetic markers, was easily the most promising vertebrate species. The plan was to make artificial mice: within each, cells with different, rather than identical, genotypes would be included. ' Certain kinds of mosaicism had previously been extensively employed in studies with Drosophila.' The first indication, in a mammal, of an admixture of genotypes came with Owen's discovery of erythrocyte mosaicism in fraternal cattle co-twins.3 Efforts to devise suitable techniques were begun in 1960 and eventually met with success (Fig. 1). Procedural details have been presented elsewhere.' Developing eggs are removed from donor females within the period from two cells through morula, and are explanted to a serum-containing medium. The surrounding membrane (zona pellucida) is digested away with 0.5 per cent pronase, and rinsed, denuded eggs of similar stage and different genotypes (shown as black and white) are placed in contact at 370C for adhesion between apposed blastomeres. During subsequent culture, cells migrate randomly within each aggregate, forming a composite sphere which becomes a single blastocyst (after 1 day, if explants were at the 8-cell stage). Blastocysts are then surgically transferred to the uterus of an \"incubator\" mother (usually of the ICR strain), who is pseudopregnant following mating with a tested, sterile (vasectomized) male on the day after the fertile matings of the egg donors. Parturition occurs at the normal time, and surrogate mothers generally take good care of the young. Size-control mechanisms restore normal embryo size shortly after implantation, thus obviating any necessity for employing half-embryos rather than entire embryos in the original aggregated pair. Striking though this regulation may seem, it is not surprising if viewed as an exaggerated manifestation of the normal mechanisms which must exist to restrict growth of organized embryos in contrast to unrestrained proliferation of embryo cells in cell culture. The first viable, demonstrably mosaic mice of quadriparental lineage were born in 1965.1 Since then, some 500 morphologically normal adult animals have been produced by these methods, and many have by now lived out a full lifespan. They, in turn, have left over 25,000 offspring.

In beef cattle, however, twinning can considerably increase the efficiency of production. Low heritability, a long generation interval for progeny testing, sex-limited expression and an unfavourable correlation with milk yield make twinning difficult to control by selection.

Embryos of high genetic quality can be obtained from oocytes collected from slaughtered house ovaries or from donors of high genetic quality by ultrasound guided follicular aspiration. In vitro maturation (IVM), in vitro fertilization (IVF) and in vitro culture (IVC) of bovine oocytes are valuable tools that can be easily applied for both research and agricultural purposes. Because of low efficiency of superovulation and high cost of FSH, in vitro embryo production (IVEP) technology has been researched in the last decade as an efficient alternate to in vivo system. It also offers new dimension in research and development for further application in the genetic improvement of farm animals. The efficiency of IVF in buffalo is much lower than that in cattle. Despite technological progress in the last two decades, the practical application of in vitro fertilization technology (IVF) is still less than anticipated because of low efficiency and high cost. INTRODUCTION In vitro embryo production (IVEP) is a reproductive biotechnology that has great potential for speeding up genetic improvement in cattle. The in vitro production and storage of gametes and embryos with high competence to development is the key of success for several technologies including transgenesis and assisted reproduction. The IVEP is preferred over in-vivo generation due to availability of large number of embryos & conveniency (Madan et al., 1991). Due to limitation of repeated induction of superovulation, the OPU (Ovum pick up) at frequent intervals in combination with IVF-IVC is providing as a more efficient method of producing embryos from selected donors (Devaraj, 2006). Some commercial applications of in vitro fertilization technology have included efforts to: (1) upgrade the productive and genetic performance of animals; (2) to overcome infertility of valuable high yielding animals; (3) to produce transgenic and cloned animals; (4) provide a source of sexed embryos; (5) for twin production in beef cattle; and (6) at the molecular level, the technique is used to elucidate events In Vitro Production of Bovine Embryo: An Overview Indian Farmer 3(1): 015-019; January-2016 Parikh et al 16 | P a g e related to maturation, fertilization of oocytes and development of embryos. In vitro production of Bovine Embryo: Major steps involved in In vitro production of bovine embryo are oocyte recovery, In vitro maturation of oocyte, In vitro capacitation of spermatozoa, In vitro fertilization and In vitro embyo culture. 1. Oocyte Recovery: Various methods of retrival of oocytes from slaughter house specimens like aspiration of oocyte from surface of follicle, collection of oocyte after isolation of individual follicle and slicing of ovary have been developed (Chauangsoongneon and Kamonpatana, 1991). Higher numbers of oocytes were recovered per ovary by slicing method (Dutta and Goswami, 1998). Laproscopy, endoscopy and transvaginal ultrasound guided follicle aspiration (TUGA) technique can also be used to recover oocytes from live animals (Pieterse et al.,1988). TUGA is less dependants on the reproductive status of the donor, with use of TUGA oocytes can be harvested from juvenile animals and pregnant animals in the first 3 months of pregnancy, but the success in term of available follicles and quality of oocytes was low (Munjunatha and Devaraj, 2006). 2. In vitro maturation of oocyte: Oocytes with compact multilayered cumulus cells and evenly granulated cytoplasm are selected for in vitro maturation (Albertini et al., 2001). Prolonging bovine sperm-Oocyte incubation in modified medium-199 improves embryo development rate & the viability of vitrified blastocyst (Nedambale et al., 2006). Most widely used complex media for In vitro maturation is Tissue Culture Medium199 (TCM-199) with Earle\u2019s salt, L-glutamine and 25 mM HEPES supplemented with 10-20% heat inactivated serum. Ham\u2019s F-10, Ham\u2019s F-12, CR1aa, MEMMinimal Essential Medium, Synthetic Bovine Oviductal Fluid medium are also used as complex media for IVM. Medias are also supplemented with fetal calf serum (FCS), estrus cow serum (ECS), new born calf serum (NBCS) (Gandhi et al., 2000), superovulated cow serum (SCS), anoestrus cow serum (ACS) or bovine serum albumin (BSA) like ingredients as well as hormones like pituitary FSH and/or LH (gonadotrophins) with estrdial-17\u00e2 either alone or in combination or with extra gonadotropin hormones like human chorionic gonadotrophins (hCG) or equine chorionic gonadotropin (eCG) are also used. Some laboratories also prefer to add growth factors like epidermal growth factor (EGF) (Nedambale et al., 2006), EGF plus fibroblast growth factor (FGF), insulin like growth factor (IGF), insulin, transferrin sodium selenite (ITS) (Galli et al., 2001) etc. for improvement of maturation in vitro. An In vitro maturation rate of 85% has been reported in TCM-199 with steer serum 10% and PMSG-40 IU/ml (Ravindranath et al., 2003). 3. In vitro capacitation of spermatozoa: Sperms used for fertilization should pass through process of capacitation. Capacitation leads to an acrosomal reaction which causes a release of acrosomal enzymes needed for penetration of different layers of ovum during Indian Farmer 3(1): 015-019; January-2016 Parikh et al 17 | P a g e fertilization. For capacitation frozen semen is used and Percoll based separation system is the most common method for isolating the motile sperm fraction after thawing (Galli et al., 2003). Although other systems can also be used like swim-up, simple centrifugation but separation through a Percoll gradient offers the consistency, flexibility and reliability as well as it reduces the polyspermy \u2013 major cause of IVF failure (Mermillod et al., 1990). Sperm can be artificially capicited by High ionic strength media (Brackett et al., 1982), High pH, Glycosamine glycan such as Heparin (Numbe et al., 2001), Bovine follicular fluid, Calcium ionopore, Caffeine and pentoxyphylline (Numbe et al., 2001), Caffeine and Theophylline (Chauhan et al., 1998), Mixture of penicillamine, hypotaurine and epinephrine (PHE) as well as by Bovine Serum Albumin. 4. In vitro fertilization: Buffalo oocytes matured in vitro are generally fertilized with frozen-thawed in vitro capacitated spermatozoa in Tyrode's Albumin Lactate Pyruvate (TALP) medium or a SOF (Synthetic bovine Oviductal Fluid ) based medium both without glucose and with varying concentration of heparin (Galli et al., 2003). Fert-CDM medium with non-essential amino acids (Lu and Seidel, 2002) is also used for incubation medium. An in-vitro fertilization rate of 6080% has been reported in both BO medium and HEPESTALP medium (Misra, 2005). Suthar (2008) used m-TALP and m-SOF medium for in vitro fertilization and found 64% fertilization rate in eight HF x Sahiwal crossbred cows. 5. In vitro embyo culture: Several protocols have been developed and applied for embryo culture. They include various co culture and cell-free systems and also the in vivo culture procedure in the surrogate sheep and rabbit oviduct. In IVC the TCM-199 is supplemented with serum and oviductal cells of Ovine or Bovine origin is used. The evaluation and selection of embryos for transfer or freezing is conducted on Day 7. By this time normally developing embryos should have reached at least the early blastocyst stage (Galli et al., 2003). Much research is still needed in domestic animal on mechanisms controlling embryo development and on development of totally in vitro system for embryo culture.", "year": 2015, "openAccessPdf": null, "authors": [{"authorId": "51041353", "name": "Priti Saha"}, {"authorId": "90057862", "name": "Tanmay Hazra"}, {"authorId": "145479129", "name": "P.

The interesting results obtained by Owen1 and by Medawar et aL2S in dizygotic cattle twins indicated one such possibility. Embryonal parabiosis of chicks makes it possible to produce experimental conditions similar to those occurring in natural cattle parabionts. Two bird fetuses are joined by their chorioallantoic membranes and, within a short period, the circulations of the two embryos are joined. Parabiosis is interrupted physiologically on hatching. Using embryonal parabiosis, the hypothesis of Burnet and Fenner4 was confirmed experimentally. This hypothesis maintained that exposure of embryos to foreign antigenic substances may cause specific suppression of immune responses during postembryonic life. Parabionts cannot form mutual antibodies after immunization with blood cells although, in chickens, immunization with blood cells from a randomly chosen individual practically always leads to the formation of a n t i b ~ d y . ~ It was shown later that the inability to form agglutinins is maintained even when blood chimeras no longer can bc demonstrated in these animak6 Using embryonal parabiosis, immunological tolerance of homotransplants was induced experimentally,7 thus confirming the rcsults of Billingham et a1.8 concerning acquired tolerance of homotransplants. Tolerated homotransplants survive for long periods of time in parabionts. However, it is not yet known why, after long periods of survival, they are sloughed. Of 1.5 tolerated homotransplants studied over a long period in chickens, 12 survived 6 to 18 months, 2 for more than 2 years, and 1 has survived 4 years a t the time of writing. Parabionts between chickens and pheasants, chickens and guinea fowl, chickens and turkeys, and chickens and ducks were studied. I t could be shown that the degree of immunological tolerance of heterotransplants is much less than with homotransplants. Heterotransplants in parabionts can survive for longer periods than in controls, but tolerance soon disappears.$ Similar results were obtained when studying immune heteroagglutinin formation. In interspecific parabionts, decreased agglutinin formation was found, as distinguished from the finding in control animals, but this was less obvious than in intraspecific parabionts.l0 These results indicate the significance of the quality of the antigenic stimulus when inducing immunological tolerance.

This gene is located in BTA 6 and having 7 exons. SPP1 gene has roles in bone mineralization, cancer metastasis, cell-mediated immune responses, inflammation and cell attachment. Polymorphisms in cattle and buffaloes were reported by various workers. SPP1 gene has potent roles in growth, production and reproduction of the animals. This gene is said to be associated with various traits like milk yield and milk compositions, growth and body weight, stillbirth and dystocia, mastitis and infections in bovine. OPN is reported to upregulate and promote the expression and secretion of Th1 cytokines. SPP1 variants are associated with mastitis resistance. SPP1 is involved in muscle regeneration after injury. There is increase in SPP1 expression in subclinical cows compared to control cows in Johne's disease. OPN has an important anti-apoptotic factor in many circumstances.

However, since that time it has become evident that tolerance may be secondary to several unrelated mechanisms and today tolerance may be best defined as \"a physiologic state in which the immune system does not react destructively against the organism that harbors it\" (Schwartz 1993). Conversely, autoimmunity is best defined as a situation where tolerance is abolished and the immune system reacts destructively against itself.

DSDs are serious problems in animal breeding, as they lead to sterility. In cattle, the most common form of DSD is freemartinism, which manifests as the presence of leukocyte chimerism (XX/XY), and occurs in heifers originating from heterosexual twin pregnancy. Other forms of DSD are rarely observed in this species. In this study, we describe a very rare diploid/triploid (60,XX/90,XXY) condition in a DSD heifer. Comprehensive clinical, anatomical, histopathological and genetic analysis was performed. Abstract In this study, we describe an eighteen-month-old Holstein\u2013Friesian heifer with a deformed vulva, located abdominally. The heifer showed typical signs of estrus. A comprehensive anatomical and histopathological examination revealed a blind-ended vagina and an additional section of urethra, which became a part of the shortened penis. Cytogenetic analysis showed the presence of two cell lines: 60,XX and 90,XXY. The frequency of the triploid cell line was low (3%) in leukocytes and elevated (35%) in fibroblasts. The molecular detection of Y-linked genes (SRY and AMELY) in the blood, skin, hair follicles, and buccal epithelial cells confirmed the presence of a cell line carrying the Y chromosome. Genotyping of 16 microsatellite markers in DNA isolated from hair follicles and fibroblast culture showed the presence of one (homozygous) or two variants (heterozygous) at all the studied loci, and allowed chimerism to be excluded. We concluded that the heifer had diploid/triploid (60,XX/90,XXY) mosaicism. To our knowledge, this is only the fifth such case to be reported worldwide in this species. Since cytogenetic studies are routinely performed on in vitro cultured leukocytes, we suspect that the prevalence of this chromosome abnormality is underestimated, as it is known from published reports that the frequency of the triploid cell line is usually very low in leukocytes.", "year": 2021, "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://www.mdpi.com/2076-2615/11/2/285/pdf?version=1611393307", "status": "GOLD"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "6069817", "name": "I.

Microchimerism can occur as a result of iatrogenic operations such as transplantation or transfusion, as well as spontaneously between twins or a mother and foetus. This results in the presence of maternal cells in the foetal circulation, a condition known as maternal microchimerism (MMc), as well as foetal cells in the maternal circulation, a condition known as foetal microchimerism (FMc). In 1893, Georg Schmorl initially reported FMc, when he discovered placental trophoblast cells in women who died of eclampsia. Foetal cells are now well proven to enter the maternal bloodstream throughout both human and rodent gestations. Foetal cells can be detected in multiple organs of the mother, including bone marrow, kidney, liver, heart and brain. Foetal cells have multilineage potential and can differentiate into different cell types in maternal organs such as blood, skin and the central nervous system. The purpose of foetal cells in maternal tissues is unclear, while numerous ideas include cancer encouragement, immune surveillance protection and tissue repair participation, which may be governed by the phenotype acquired by these cells. In addition to humans and mice, FMc has been reported in several animals, such as cattle and goats. Cell transfer in multiparous, multichorionic animals like domestic pigs, on the other hand, has received less attention. A study concluded that the epitheliochorial structure of the pig placenta efficiently limits cellular interchange during pregnancy. Therefore, whether there is microchimerism in domestic pigs still needs to be further studied. Foetuses with GFP markers would be a better tool for studying foetal microchimerism. In this study, we first created a GFP overexpression vector. The schematic diagram of the GFP overexpression vector construction is shown in Figure 1A. In order to achieve targeted insertion of the expression vector by CRISPR/Cas9 cleavage, a GFP expression vector with a CAG promoter was created and 800 bp left and right homologous arms were added to both sides of the expression vector. We designed identification primers on the outer and inner homologous arms of the insertion gene locus, respectively, to confirm the insertion at the pig Rosa26 locus. HR-L represented upstream identification and HR-R represented downstream insertion site identification (Figure 1B). The monoclonal cell line we screened for inserted the target GFP sequence was at the locus of fixation. To further confirm the correct insertion site sequence, PCR products were sequenced, and the results showed that the target insertion sequence of the cell line we obtained was correct (Figure 1C and Method S1). The correctly targeted clones were identified by GFP expression, and used as nuclear donors to construct cloned embryos by SCNT (Figure 1D and Method S2). Compared with the control group, the cloned embryos did not differ significantly in the rate of development to blastocyst and expressed a high level of GFP. The GFP-1 cell line was utilized to create 1340 cloned embryos, which were subsequently transferred into five surrogate sows. After 30 days, three surrogates detected pregnancy by B-scan ultrasonography. Finally, 13 piglets were born naturally from three surrogates (Figure 1E and Method S3). The newborn piglets were kept in a clean conventional housing environment. GFP piglets were identified as having green eyes under sunlight and a green whole body under UV light, which was significantly different from WT pigs (Figure 1F). To determine whether piglet cells could enter the sows during pregnancy, the peripheral blood of pregnant sows was first examined. After lysis of the red blood cells, the peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were used for testing by flow cytometry (Method S4). We found that 0.043% of GFP positive cells were present in PBMC and 88.3% of these cells were CD3 T cells (Figure 1G). Under fluorescent microscopy, we also observed the presence of GFP positive cells in the sow's blood (Figure 1H). To find out whether foetal cells could also circulate through the blood to other organs of the surrogates, we euthanized the sows after delivery and examined the presence of GFP positive cells in other organs by freezing sections (Method S5). More GFP positive cells were found in immune organs such as the spleen and lymph nodes, and small numbers of GFP positive cells were observed in the lungs, liver, intestine, brain and heart, no obvious presence of GFP positive cells was observed in kidney tissues (Figure 1I). Since the genetic material of these cloned GFP piglets was derived from male foetal fibroblasts and the SRY gene was only expressed in boars, any foetal cells that entered the mother can be identified by SRY detection. By testing the peripheral blood of the surrogate sows, we detected the SRY gene in two out of the three surrogate sows (Figure 1J and Method S6). In addition to the kidneys, we detected SRY genes in the heart, liver, spleen, lungs, large intestine, small intestine, brain, and bone marrow of the surrogate sows (Figure 1J).

The feasibility of transplanting organ allografts2 was demonstrated for the first time with kidneys in 1959. During the preceding 15 years, it had been established that rejection of skin allografts in experimental animals (1) and humans (2) is an immunologic response and that analogous events cause destruction of canine (3,4) and human kidney allografts. The only exception was with identical twins, between whom tissues and organs (isografts) can be freely exchanged (5,6).Before 1959, most of the human kidney allografts were transplanted to non-immunosuppressed recipients.3 The kidneys were obtained from recently deceased persons (e.g., in France after guillotine execution) or in the United States from surgical patients from whom a kidney was removed for a variety of non-transplant objectives (7-12), and from a mother in France who was the first recorded living organ donor (for her son) (13).No matter what the source of the renal allografts, the pace of the rejection was much the same and was complete in a few days or weeks. Efforts up to 1959 to prevent the rejection of renal allografts by weakening the recipient immune response with irradiation or drug immunosuppression had failed to produce kidney allograft survival in humans or in any animal model for as long as 30 days. Consequently, the successful kidney alloengraftments accomplished in humans between 1959 and 1963 (table 1) were surprising to almost all immunologists, physicians, and surgeons.In retrospect, however, there had been clues suggesting the theoretical possibility of organ alloengraftment, beginning with observations in \"freemartin cattle.\" In these bovine fraternal twins, the placentas are fused during uterine gestation, allowing fetal cross-circulation (fig. 1, inset I).4 In 1945, it had been reported by Ray Owen (APS 1984) that each member of a freemartin pair contained the other's blood cells after birth and throughout life (persistent blood chimerism) (14).The blood chimerism subsequently was incorporated by the Australian Macfarlane Burnet (APS I960) in the clonal selection theory of immunity that became the cornerstone of modern immunology (15). As part of his hypothesis, Burnet predicted that the cattle twins would be able by virtue of their chimerism to freely exchange all tissues. In 1952, Peter Medawar (APS 1961) and his English team validated this prediction with skin graft experiments in both same-sex and cross-sex cattle twin pairs (16), and then proceeded in 1953 to demonstrate that similar non-responsiveness (acquired immunologic tolerance) could be deliberately produced in mice.In the mouse experiments, Medawar and his associates, Rupert Billingham and Leslie Brent, transplanted allogeneic spleen cells from adult donors into immunologically immature animals (17,18) (fig. 2, outer rim). This was the forerunner model of bone marrow cell transplantation for humans afflicted with immune deficiency diseases (fig.l, inset 2a). In a second model, Main and Prehn (19) in Bethesda reduced the immune responsiveness of adult recipient mice by total body irradiation prior to the transplantation of bone marrow cells (fig. 2, center). This model ultimately evolved into clinical bone marrow transplantation for a wide range of hematologic and other indications (fig. 1, inset 2b). Under both circumstances depicted in figure 2, the mouse recipients engrafted with donor leukocytes could accept other tissues from the same donor. Thus, the strong association of acquired donor-specific tolerance with donor leukocyte chimerism was formally established.A three-step strategy derived from the mouse experiments that could permit organ engraftment in patients was promptly envisioned by surgeons (20,21). It consisted of weakening the recipient's immune system with total body irradiation as had been done by Main and Prehn, infusion of donor lymphopoietic (e. \u2026", "year": 2011, "openAccessPdf": null, "authors": [{"authorId": "145519103", "name": "T.

Eighty percent of cows had left-sided DA, and 20% had right-sided DA. In > 50% of affected cows, clinical signs appeared just before calving to 2 weeks after calving. Incidence of twin calves and periparturient diseases was significantly higher in affected cows than in the overall Swedish cow population. Content of neutral detergent fiber in the silage was low in herds with DA. Feeding a total mixed ration was a risk factor for DA. Treatment by surgical methods gave a significantly higher recovery rate than nonsurgical methods.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE\nDisplaced abomasum is a periparturient nutritional disease. Feeding roughage with low neutral detergent content is a more important causative factor than the amount of concentrates fed at the time of calving. The basic principle for prevention of DA is to maintain good ruminal filling before and at calving. The amount of high-quality roughage fed before and at calving should be kept to a minimum. By changing routines for periparturient feeding, it should be possible to reduce the incidence of DA.", "year": 2002, "openAccessPdf": null, "authors": [{"authorId": "4783664", "name": "L.

Four fortnights distributed over the main lactation period were covered. In three of the fortnights, the observations were made on six 24 hr. periods, while in the remaining fortnight the cows were observed on all 14 days. 2. Anoutstanding feature of the grazing behaviour of dairy cattle is its variability, due to external and internal conditions. 3. Of the external factors, climate (in a temperate zone) is relatively unimportant. 4. The quantity and quality of the herbage offered are of importance in modifying the grazing behaviour of dairy cattle. Under adverse pasture conditions there is, in general, an increase of total working time (grazing + ruminating): grazing time increases with scarcity of herbage and with mixed quality, while ruminating time is prolonged by poor quality grass. 5. Ruminating time is strongly dependent on the quantity and quality of the ingested grass, but the relationship is, for various reasons, obscured in a field trial such as the present. 6. The adaptation of grazing habits to new conditions is very rapid. 7. Feed requirement for milk production is the most important internal factor determining variation in the length of grazing time. 8. Inheritance \u00d7 environment interactions as a source of variations in grazing times are due to the following factors: (a) Differences amongst twin sets in lactational persistency, which presumably cause parallel differences in feed requirements. (b) Differences in the response of high and low producing twin sets to varying pasture conditions. (c) Non-analysable idiosyncrasies common to the members of some twin sets. 9.

Five sets from 10 Wagyu artificial identical twins were divided to into 2 groups, a restricted group (Test) and a supplied group (Control). The body weight at the finishing time of the Test was significantly lower than that of the Control (p<0.05). The daily gain from 13 to 21 months old, as the animals in the Test were fed the concentrated feed without Vitamin A, was significantly different (p<0.05) between the Test and the Control. The total daily gains for the Test and the Control for the fattening period were 0.82 kg/day and 0.93 kg/day, respectively, which showed a significant difference (p<0.01). Regarding the rib thickness, the Test was thinner than the Control. The Beef Marbling Scores of the Test and Control were 3.60 and 2.80, respectively. The muscle weight of the Test was significantly smaller than that of the Control (p<0.01). However, regarding the ratio to the carcass, the Test was significantly higher than the Control (p<0.05). For the fat weight, the Test was smaller by about 15 kg than the Control (p<0.01). Furthermore, for the fat ratio to the carcass, the Test was significantly lower than the Control (p<0.05). The bone weights of the two groups were approximately the same. Regarding the ratio of bone to carcass, the Test was higher than the Control (p<0.01). For the younger fattening method, the low level vitamin A in the serum had the effect that the muscle ratio to the carcass weight was greater and the fat was less, but the carcass and muscle weight were less.

Injection of FSH was initiated at day 2 (Treatment I), day 10 (Treatment II) and at day 18 (Treatment III) of estrus cycle. A total of 6 ml Folltropin (Equivalent 120 mg FSH) was intramussculary injected in decreasing dossis method twice a day with 12 hours interval for 4 days. Blood was collected on day 12 of estrus cycle for progesterone level. Data recorded were the diameter of ovary (DO), total corpus luteum (TCL), concentration of progesterone (P), percentage of pregnancy and number of birth. The means DO, TCL and P were significantly (P < 0.05) higher after injection (2.0 cm; 2.1 and 1.6 ng/ml) than those before injection (1.4 cm, 1.0 dan 0.6 ng/ml).

The mechanism by which this works is unclear and may differ between species. In cattle it is believed that buserelin, by reducing oestrogen concentrations, causes the development of endometrial oxytocin receptors to be delayed. Luteal oxytocin binds with these receptors to promote the formation and secretion of prostaglandin. Any delay in the release of PGF2\u03b1 would allow an underdeveloped embryo extra time to produce and release the maternal recognition of pregnancy signal, which might otherwise be lost following luteolysis. This may also be the mechanism in sheep and pigs although an increase in progesterone concentrations could also be important. However in the mare, following buserelin administration at 9 or 10 days after the detection of ovulation, pregnancy rates are already increased by 12-13 days compared with untreated controls, i.e. before the time of luteolysis, without any change in progesterone concentrations. In addition to an increased pregnancy rate, the twin embryo rate is also increased and subsequent embryo loss rate reduced. The possible mechanisms by which this may result in the mare are discussed.", "year": 2014, "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://doi.org/10.4172/2157-7579.1000151", "status": "BRONZE"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "50375653", "name": "J.

Early post-traumatic period is critical for the development of short or long-term complications and research on risk factors has been about age, sex, earlier trauma experience, social attachment/ caring environment, biological/genetic predisposition to traumatization, severity of trauma, existence and duration of post-traumatic functional disability, possible aesthetic damage and need for reconstruction (face, body), the personality of the person who gets injured, and other. (1) Vulnerable persons may develop addictions like drug abuse, alcohol addiction, and self-destructing behavior (1) or phobias. (2) J Cole has mentioned that rituals can heal community pain or trauma; he used the argument on the example of the Betsimisaraka of east Madagascar who used rituals of cattle sacrifice to transform the pain they experienced during an anticolonial rebellion that took place in 1947. (3) Traumatiologists call hysteria the behavior of patients who over-react after moderate injuries and ask to be operated, to be admitted to hospital, demand more days of hospitalization and prolongation of orthopedic supports' use. However, this \"diagnosis\" is not acceptable by psychiatrists: \"Like the psychiatric hospitals, which have changed from being lunatic asylums to mental hospitals, so the term hysteria has become unpopular in practice and in diagnostic classifications. Both DSM-111 and DSM-1V have avoided the term hysterical personality and use histrionic personality disorder\". (4) According to the theory of allostasis, the vulnerability and total damage caused to person who is exposed to stress is a combination of past traumatic experiences and the current traumatic conditions (1) stress load. The term allostatic load (5) describes the load of stress one carries since he was born, while the load coming from parents and older generations is today believed to be transferred genetically (6) or via unknown mechanisms as an extra amount of inherited allostatic load. (7) Because PTSD (Post Traumatic Stress Disorder) seems to be more frequent that we thought in the past, specialized trauma scales are used to measure either the development of PTSD or the Pseudo-PTSD. (8) To investigate washing ritual, feelings of dirtiness without physical contact (described as mental pollution) were produced in an experiment designed by Fairbrother N et al (9); in this pioneering experimental model of mental pollution, female university undergraduates developed rinsing/washing behavior to counteract feelings of mental pollution. (9) On the contrary, agoraphobia or other phobias are largely innate according to the study of Kendler KS et al, who investigated 5 phobia subtypes (agoraphobia, social, animal, situational, and blood or injury) in 7500 twins. (10) Sex differences in the phenotypic expression of obsessive-compulsive disorder were investigated in a research from Brazil. (2) According to this study, obsessive-compulsive symptoms (OCS) started earlier and probably had a worse impact in men, \"while women were more likely to present comorbid simple phobias, eating disorders in general and anorexia in particular, impulse control disorders in general, and compulsive buying and skin picking in particular\". (2) Compulsive features in the character of a person who gets injured is a predisposing factor for the development of a post-trauma obsessive compulsive disorder and the clinical manifestation of therapeutic rituals, even if the injury is not serious. (1) As far as age differences are concerned, Mancebo MC et al investigated the clinical features of juvenile-onset Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD) in children, adolescents and adults. According to that study, juvenile-onset OCD symptoms expression was remarkably similar across the lifespan. However, compared with adults, juveniles were more likely to be male, recall an earlier age at OCD onset and have different lifetime comorbidity patterns. \u2026", "year": 2009, "openAccessPdf": null, "authors": [{"authorId": "52404215", "name": "IRENE CHRISTODOULOU"}, {"authorId": "2007520206", "name": "Elias Kallistratos"}]}

In this study, six dairy cows were fed varying levels of the surfactant (10, 20, or 40g per cow per day) for 12 wk, and six cows served as controls. The surfactant had no deleterious effect on milk production, milk fat test, body weight, feed consumption, conception rate, or animal health. Two sets of fistulated identical twin animals were used to determine the surfactant's effect on rumen fermentation. A reversal design of feeding was used. Ten grams of surfactant daily seemed not to affect rumen ammonia concentration, rumen pH, or rumen lactic and volatile fatty acid concentration. Inocula from surfactant-fed and control animals digested similar quantities of cellulose in vitro. The results appear to justify the conclusion that feeding the bloat-preventive agent in quantities up to 40g per day does not deleteriously affect dairy animals.", "year": 1965, "openAccessPdf": null, "authors": [{"authorId": "30515859", "name": "L.

However, only 30% of the twins retained their cotwin's allografts longer than 2 years; some grafts were viable after 5 years. The results indicate that chimeric twins exhibit a high degree of acquired immunological tolerance for the histocompatibility antigens of skin. Most of the second-set and all of the subsequent cotwin grafts were rejected. Furthermore, the differences in response between members of a twin pair noted for first-set grafts were not apparent with later grafts, suggesting that a chimera can mount a sufficient immune response to reject its cotwin's skin. Since these twins exhibited erythrocyte chimerism, it is concluded that they were completely and permanently tolerant to erythropoietic antigens but only partially tolerant to histocompatibility antigens of skin. Thus, communal circulation of twin fetuses which produces chimerism leads to different results for these different tissues. Apparently, cattle erythrocytes do not carry major histocompatibility antigens; therefore, chimerism of erythropoietic elements is independent of graft response. Some suggestion that lymphocytes of cattle do not carry all of the antigens carried by skin was obtained.

Nowadays, easy, economic and effective methods are developed for synchronization of cattle. The aim of this study was to adapt the Ovsynch protocol for cattle to the ewes. For this purpose 150 Tahirova ewes and 6 rams were used. The ewes in breeding season were randomly divided into three groups. On day 0 GnRh and day 6 PGF2\u03b1+PMSG administered to each of the ewes. In addition to this hCG was injected to the ewes of Group 2 and 3 on the 8 th day and also estradiol propionat (EP) was administered to the ewes of Group 3 on the day 7.5. Matings have taken place in 68% of Group 1 on the first day and in 32% on the second day. These results were 80% on the first day, 8% on the 2 nd day and 12% on the 3 rd day in Group 2; 72% on the first day, 11% on the 2 nd day and 6% on the 3 rd day in Group 3. In Group 1 there were 9 twins (18.7%) out of 48 births. In Group 2 total 49 births, of which 11 twins (22.4%) and in Group 3, 5 (10.4%) of 48 births were twins. By the present study, the reproductive and breeding characteristics of Tahirova, a highly productive and adopted sheep have been determined and recorded. The ovsynch protocol which had been developed for dairy cattle have been modified for sheep and named as EWESYNCH.

The objectives of this study were to develop a powerful diagnostic test for chimaerism in bovine male and female co-twins using X and Y chromosome-linked markers and to determine the extent of chimaerism in twins, triplets and quadruplets. We developed a multiplex PCR set of three polymorphic markers on chromosome X (DIK2865, DIK2283, AGLA257), where the presence of >1 and >2 alleles per marker is sufficient to prove chimaerism in males and females, respectively. In addition, a specific segment on chromosome Y (BOV97M) is included in the set to indicate chimaerism in females. Visualization of chimaeric alleles was best for DNA extracted from blood, fair for DNA from vaginal smears and failed for DNA extracted from hair. The power of chimaerism identification using this set of markers for DNA extracted from blood was calculated as 99% in males and virtually 100% in females. All females and males in heterosexual twins, triplets and quadruplets displayed evidence of a chimaeric allele in at least one and maximum of three of three X chromosome markers analysed. In addition, all females showed the presence of the BOV97M segment and were validated as chimaeric by the standard clinical diagnosis of impaired vaginal length. Quantitative PCR analysis of BOV97M copies in all twins vs. their sires showed a mean ratio of 45-68% in females and 39-49% in males, indicating a substantial symmetrical exchange of cells among all co-twins. The proposed analysis of X and Y chromosome-linked markers is advantageous to previous methods based on Y chromosome sequences only, because it detects chimaerism in both male and female co-twins.", "year": 2011, "openAccessPdf": null, "authors": [{"authorId": "2240504475", "name": "Micha Ron"}, {"authorId": "50172534", "name": "B.

It is open to us to abstain, in a very large degree, from rendering the air impure. By the efficient application of disinfectants to foul surfaces, we may hinder defilement of the atmosphere of our dwellings. One of the main functions of a serviceable disinfectant is that it shall be antiseptic; that it shall postpone decomposition and putrefaction until a convenient season. A good disinfectant should not itself defile air, neither should it be dangerously poisonous or corrosive. There is a very common substance which has long been used to hinder putrefaction. It does so only in a concentrated form. It has no smell ; it is not poisonous. It can hardly be said to be corrosive. Its name is common salt.

The first aim was to examine whether or not early pregnancy-associated thrombocytopenia (EPAT) occurred in cows following nonsurgical embryo transfer by observing the daily patterns of the concentration of peripheral platelets (PLT) during the preimplantation period of pregnancy. The other goal was to assess the use of PLT count as a diagnosis of early pregnancy in cows. In Experiment 1, out of 50 Holstein parous cows, 40 had one embryo nonsurgically transferred to each uterine horn on Day 6 or 7 (Day 0=onset of standing estrus). The remaining 10 cows served as controls having no embryos transferred. Blood was taken daily at the same time, from Day 6 or 7 following estrus (the day when the embryos were transferred in the non-controls) to the day of return to estrus for control cows and non-pregnant cows, or to Day 36 for pregnant cows. Bilateral embryo transfers resulted in 9 twin, 14 single, and 17 nonpregnancies. Some recipient cows showed an increase in PLT following embryo transfer, while others displayed a decrease in PLT. If significant PLT change was characterized either by a decrease or an increase of >20% compared to the value of pre-transfer, the proportions of cows indicating significant change were 78% (7/9) in twin, 64% (9/14) in single, 76% (13/17) in nonpregnancies and 30% (3/10) in controls. The proportions in twin (P<0.05), single (P<0.05) and nonpregnancies (P<0.01) were higher than that in controls. The effect of the particular group on PLT was significant (P<0.0025). In Experiment 2, each of several in vitro-produced blastocysts were nosurgically transferred to 9 Japanese Black cows on Day 7 or 8 following onset of estrus. Seven days after embryo transfer, an attempt to recover the previously transferred embryos by nonsurgical flushing was performed. Embryos could be recovered on Day 14 or 15 from 5 animals, whose blood was taken from the day of embryo transfer to the next day of embryo recovery and during the corresponding days of the following estrous cycle. For PLT, differences were detected between the both phases of 3 out of the 5 cows. The individual PLT variation in response means that EPAT does not necessarily occur in cows following embryo transfer, and that the use of PLT counts is unlikely to be clinically useful in assessing early pregnancy in cows. These results may suggest, however, that maternal platelet activation would occur during early pregnancy in cattle.", "year": 1996, "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/jrd/42/4/42_4_225/_pdf", "status": "BRONZE"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "46991461", "name": "T.

More specifically, we focused on the influence of genes located in the non-autosomal region of the Y chromosome and the contribution of paternal imprinting. Our analyses were performed on 8130 BWT and 1245 WWT records from 12 and 2 purebred herds, respectively, they being collected between years 1986 and 2010. All animals included in the study were registered in the Yield Recording Scheme of the Bruna dels Pirineus breed. Both BWT and WWT were analyzed using a univariate linear animal model, and the relevance of paternal imprinting and Y chromosome-linked effects were checked by the deviance information criterion (DIC). In addition to sire-specific and direct genetic effects, our model accounted for random permanent effects (dam and herd-year-season) and three systematic sources of variation, that is, sex of the calf (male or female), age of the dam at calving (six levels) and birth type (single or twin). Both weight traits evidenced remarkable effects from the Y chromosome, whereas paternal imprinting was only revealed in WWT. Note that differences in DIC between the preferred model and the remaining ones exceed 39 000 and 2 800 000 DIC units for BWT and WWT, respectively. It is important to highlight that Y chromosome accounted for \u223c2% and \u223c6% of the total phenotypic variance for BWT and WWT, respectively, and paternal imprinting accounted for \u223c13% of the phenotypic variance for WWT. These results revealed two relevant sources of sire-specific genetic variability with potential contributions to the current breeding scheme of the Bruna dels Pirineus beef cattle breed; moreover, these sire-specific effects could be included in other beef cattle breeding programs or, at least, they must be considered and appropriately analyzed.", "year": 2012, "openAccessPdf": null, "authors": [{"authorId": "48771109", "name": "M.

The aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of some environmental factors on twinning rate and to estimate heritability. General Linear Model (GLM) within the SAS program was used to study the effect of conception season, conception year, parity and age at first calving on twinning. MIVQUE method was used to estimate component of variance for heritability of the studied trait. The overall means for twinning was 2.54%. The results obtained revealed that the trait was affected significantlly (P < 0.01 ) by season and year of conception and parity, whereas, the effect of age at first calving was not. Heritability estimated for twinning was low (0.02), which reflects the important role of environmental factors on the trait variation. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------", "year": 2016, "openAccessPdf": null, "authors": [{"authorId": "1401573213", "name": "F.

The mean number of folliclular oocytes recovered from an ovary was 10.7. The rates of maturation and fertilization in Grade I oocytes were significantly (P\uff1c0.05) higher than Graden and III. Developmental rate into blastocyst in the culture group of TCM-199 with BOEC were significantly higher (P\uff1c0.05) than the groups of TCM-199 and conditioned medium (24.7% vs. 12.4% and 18.2%). The survivability of post-thawed blastocysts equilibrated for 3 min in EFS solution was significantly (P\uff1c0.05) lower than l0 for 1 and 2 min (32.1% vs. 82.9% and 73.3%). Significantly higher (P\uff1c0.05) survival rate in blastocysts was seen after freezing than in morulae stage embryos. Out of all 105 recipients, 49 (46.7%) were confirmed in pregnant. On pregnancy of cattle, 48 calves were born from 40 recipients. The ratio of twin and single calves was 30.5% (32/40 and 7.6% (8/40), respectively.

Nonpregnant cows were culled at 326 +/- 36 d postpartum or milk yield <16.4 +/- 0.3 kg/ d. Mean durations of the voluntary waiting period were 52 +/- 1.3 and 53 +/- 1.4 d for primiparous and multiparous cows, respectively. Hormonal synchronization or timed artificial insemination programs were used in 87% of the herds, with 86% synchronizing first services, 77% resynchronizing repeat services, and 59% treating cystic, anestrous, or anovular cows. Finding good employees was identified as the greatest labor challenge, followed by training and supervising employees. Mastitis and hairy heel warts were noted as the greatest animal health concerns, followed by lameness, abortions, and death losses, whereas the greatest reproductive challenges were artificial insemination service rate, conception rate, twinning, and retained placenta or metritis.

This review discusses recent therapeutic approaches designed to reduce the incidence of early foetal loss. These strategies are based on the fact that low plasma concentrations of progesterone are commonly related to foetal loss. Progesterone supplementation during the late embryonic/early foetal period has proven useful in curtailing losses, mainly in single pregnancies, whereas a more positive effect of treatment with GnRH than progesterone has been found in twin pregnancies. Therapeutics is not necessary in cows with an additional corpus luteum. In practical terms, suggestions include recording the number of embryos and corpora lutea on first pregnancy diagnosis and checking for normal pregnancy progression on day 60 post-insemination.", "year": 2010, "openAccessPdf": null, "authors": [{"authorId": "1401582426", "name": "G.

In Exp. 1 after synchronization of ovulation, during 2 yr, 297 suckled beef cows were assigned randomly to 1 of 3 treatments: 1) on d 2 cows received a single TAI (TAI-2; n = 99), 2) a fixed-time direct transfer, frozen and thawed embryo placed in the uterine horn ipsilateral to the ovary containing a corpus luteum (CL) on d 9 embryo transfer (ET-9; n = 99), or 3) cows received TAI on d 2 and a frozen and thawed direct transfer embryo placed in the uterine horn ipsilateral to the ovary containing a CL on d 9 (TWIN) treatments (n = 99). Fetal number and viability were determined with ultrasonography at 33 to 35 d and 90 to 100 d after insemination. In Exp. 2, 74 crossbred recipient heifers were assigned randomly to receive either 1) a single whole fresh embryo (WHOLE; n = 37) or 2) 2 identical fresh demi-embryos (SPLIT; n = 37) in the uterine horn ipsilateral to the CL 7 d after an observed estrus. Ultrasonography was used on d 33, 69, and 108 to determine presence and number of embryos or fetuses. Palpation per rectum was used to determine pregnancy status on d 180 of gestation and number of live calves was recorded at birth. In Exp. 1 pregnancy rates on d 30 to 35 were greater (P < 0.05) for TWIN- (48.5%) and TAI-2- (47.5%) than for ET-9- (33.3%) treated cows. Of the 48 pregnant cows in the TWIN treatment, 21 were twin pregnancies whereas there was 1 twin pregnancy in the TAI-2 treatment. As a result, TWIN cows had more fetuses (P < 0.05) as a proportion of all treated cows (69.7%) than TAI-2- (48.5%) or ET-9-(33.3%) treated cows, and cows in the TWIN treatment gave birth to more (P < 0.01) calves (n = 55) compared with cows in the ET treatment (n = 23) whereas cows in the TAI-2 treatment (n = 40) were intermediate. In Exp. 2 heifers receiving SPLIT (81.1%) had greater (P < 0.05) pregnancy rates on d 33 than heifers receiving WHOLE (40.5%). Of the SPLIT heifers that were confirmed pregnant at d 33 after transfer, 57% were gestating twin fetuses. Embryonic or fetal loss from d 33 to birth was greater (P < 0.01) in heifers in the SPLIT treatment (40.0%) compared with the WHOLE treatment (0.0%), but number of calves per female treated was greater (P < 0.05) in heifers in the SPLIT treatment (75.0%) compared with heifers in the WHOLE treatment (40.5%). We conclude that transferring an embryo into a cow 7 d after TAI did not increase the pregnancy rate in Exp.1. However, transferring 2 demi-embryos into a single heifer recipient increased pregnancy rate at 33 d of gestation whereas both methods of inducing twinning resulted in a greater number of calves per female treated.

The method of bisection was intended to significantly lower cell loss which occurs during standard bisection. Blastocysts, obtained either in vitro or in vivo, had their zona pellucida perforated by puncturing or slitting near the inner cell mass and subsequently were cultured in vitro. During culture, hatching was characterized by the extrusion of the inner cell mass as well as trophoectodermal cells through the opening in the zona pellucida. At a certain point the hatching the blastocyst took on a figure eight shape. Cutting the narrow bridge of cells which connected both parts of the embryo led to a splitting of the embryo into two equivalent parts. The experiment determined the factors responsible for effective hatching stimulated by earlier zona pellucida perforation. The optimal stage of bovine embryo development for obtaining the highest proportion of eight-in-shape hatching was late blastocyst. At this stage eight-in-shape hatching occurred in 50.4% of the embryos (137/272) while in the case of middle blastocyst 28.3% (17/60) and expanding blastocysts 15.3% (11/72). In the cases of puncturing and slitting the zona pellucida there was a similar proportion of eight-in-shape hatching, 137/272 (50.4%) and 93/190 (48.9%), respectively. Demi-embryos produced from thirty-five blastocysts bisected by the eight-in-shape method (modified bisection) were transferred into 41 recipients. Seventeen recipients became pregnant. A l l 17 calved, resulting in 20 calves, including 4 sets of monozygotic twins. In the control group there were 13 recipients which received halves obtained from conventional blastocyst bisection.

Federation of CECOS].", "abstract": "OBJECTIVE\nTo assess pregnancies and conceptus after artificial insemination (IAD) or IVF with frozen semen donor (IVFD) on sufficiently large study population in order to distinguished minor variations.\n\n\nSTUDY DESIGN\nFrom 1987 to 1994 all pregnancies obtained after AID or IVFD where registered prospectively in the French CECOS Federation data base. Different factors were recorded for this study: first menarch age of the recipient women, cycle length, insemination date in the conception cycle, maternal age at delivery, hormonal treatments, donor age, sperm conservation length and follow up of the pregnancy: miscarriage, tubal pregnancy, time at delivery, sex of the fetus, weight, malformation.\n\n\nRESULTS\n21,597 pregnancies obtained after AID and 3381 after IVFD were registered. 2% where lost of follow up. Fetal loss rate is 18% after AID and 21.5% after AID and 1.7% after IVFD (p < 0.0001). 18,128 children were born after AID and 3,313 after IVFD. After AID the twin pregnancy rate is 6.9% and the multiple pregnancy (> or = 3 fetus) rate is 0.7%. After IVDF these rates are respectively 24.8% and 4.2% (p < 0.0001). After AID the mean weight at delivery, sex ratio, premature rate, intra uterine growth retardation rate are not different from national rates published in 1995. The fetus malformation rate (including medical abortions) is 1.9% after AID and 2.7% after IVFD (p < 0.009). After AID the trisomy 21 rate increase with the mother age but also with the donors age if the maternal age is equal. The birth defects rate is not different from those registered in Paris, Strasbourg and Marseille. The birth defects rate observed after IVDF is not different from the rate observed after IVF with husband semen (2.74% versus 2.99%, p = 0.16).\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nAfter AID the miscarriage and tubal pregnancy rate, the children weight, the premature rate is not different from the general French, population. Sex ratio is normal as the global malformation rate. The multiple pregnancy rate (x 7 for twin and by 10 for multiple pregnancies more than 3 fetus) is high showing the influence of ovulation induction treatment. The birth chromosomic abnormalities rate is normal and correlated to the mother age but also to the donor age. This result without clear biological explanation will require further verification in a greater population. Practically speaking, this observations encourages lowering the age limit for the semen donors less than 45 years. IVFD practice instead of AID double the tubal pregnancy rate (0.9% versus 1.7% and increase the twin pregnancy rate by 2.5% and the multiple pregnancy (> or = 3 fetus) rate by 3. It is necessary to promote AID from which the pregnancy rate is very different from one center to another with in the centers with AID low results a too high rate of IVFD. Finally we can say that pregnancy from IVFD or IVF with husband semen are not significantly different. In other words pregnancy outcome is not changed after sperm cryopreservation.", "year": 1996, "openAccessPdf": null, "authors": []}

In the present study, we followed the farms from the moment of oestrous synchronization, embryo transfer (two per cow), until delivery and first care of the calves. In farm A, cows presenting twin pregnancies (5 from 13) were submitted to delivery induction, as well as calves and cows were monitored after birth. In farm B, such management was not followed with the twin pregnant cows (31 from 49). In both farms, freemartinism was detected, but this was not a problem as none of the animals would be selected for breeding. No dystocia was observed in farm A, while 48% of the twin pregnancies in farm B ended up in dystocia. Furthermore, the mortality rate of new-born calves in farm A was 10%, while in farm B it reached 32%.

Insights from Multiple Ovulating Dairy Cows", "abstract": "Simple Summary The selection of a single ovarian follicle able to differentiate and ovulate is a phenomenon common to monovular species including humans. The selected follicle acquires the capacity to ovulate when it reaches a diameter of about 10 mm. In cows with a single follicle of ovulatory size, the probability of ovulation significantly increases with follicle diameter. However, two or more follicles of ovulatory size are often present at estrus. In cows with one follicle of ovulatory size and another follicle of 7\u20139 mm, the small follicle may, under certain circumstances, ovulate producing a pregnancy. Abstract In Bos. taurus cattle, follicular deviation to dominance begins when the selected ovulatory follicle reaches a mean diameter of 8.5 mm. The dominant follicle acquires the capacity to ovulate when it reaches a diameter of about 10 mm. In this study, data derived from 148 cows in estrus with one follicle of ovulatory size and another of 7\u20139 mm, reveal that the small follicle has the capacity to ovulate alone or with the dominant follicle; thus, giving rise to a single or twin pregnancy. This indicates that a follicle of deviation size may ovulate in the presence of a follicle of ovulatory size.", "year": 2022, "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://www.mdpi.com/2076-2615/12/9/1140/pdf?version=1651159784", "status": "GOLD"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "1398071649", "name": "F.

It will be the first human disease eradicated without using vaccines (or medicines). Eradication will be achieved by changing behaviour, a cause for optimism that other types of behaviour change are possible. The people who will benefit are among the poorest on the planet. Dracunculus are long, thin nematode roundworms and the name means \u2018little dragons\u2019. The disease was described by the Egyptians over 3500 years ago and by the Greeks. Dracunucliasis occurs mainly in Africa but also in India, Pakistan and Yemen. The name Guinea worm disease was given by 17thcentury European explorers visiting the West African coast of Guinea. The disease is characterised by nodular skin lesions and can be eliminated because humans are the principal host and apparently the primary means of spread, although Dracuncula can cause nodular skin lesions in other mammals including cattle. The disease is transmitted by drinking stagnant water contaminated with Guinea worm larvae, which are always carried on water fleas (Cyclops). Gastric acid kills the water fleas but not the larvae, which mature into female and much smaller male worms. The males die after mating and are absorbed, while the females grow up to a metre long and migrate over months to the skin, usually of the foot or leg, to form excruciatingly painful blisters. Bathing the foot causes the worm to release eggs into the water, which develop into larvae and the cycle continues. Pain can be debilitating enough to prevent walking. The traditional way of getting rid of the worm is by wrapping it round a stick, and rotating the stick is also painful and can take anything from hours to months (see Fig. 1). This ancient technique may be the origin of the rod and twined serpent carried by Aesculapius (or Asclepius), the Greek god of medicine and healing. The serpent-entwined rod is often used as a medical symbol (see Fig. 2) and is itself the possible origin of the white pole with the helix of stripes (red in the UK, red and blue in the USA) seen outside barbers\u2019 shops, indicating the traditional link between surgeons and barbers. In poor communities, prevention is best achieved by filtering drinking water using fine-mesh cloth filters to remove the Cyclops water fleas. In addition, cases need to be detected, their lesions washed to reduce numbers of eggs and they need to be persuaded not to set foot in community drinking water. In 1986, there were an estimated 3.5 million cases of Guinea worm disease globally. At this time, the philanthropic Carter Center, established by former US President Jimmy Carter, spearheaded a global campaign of eradication, in conjunction with the US Centers for Disease Control, WHO and UNICEF, and with later significant financial support from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and the UK Department for International Development. The Sudan Civil War impeded the programme, which has nonetheless been stunningly successful, with only Fig. 1 Painful process of extracting Guinea worms by wrapping it round a stick (from http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guinea_worm_disease). doi:10.1111/jpc.12106 bs_bs_banner", "year": 2013, "openAccessPdf": null, "authors": [{"authorId": "2298438", "name": "D.

The objective of this study was to perform a comprehensive genomic analysis of blood total Ca concentration in periparturient Holstein cows. We first performed a genomic scan and a subsequent gene-set analysis to identify candidate genes, biological pathways, and molecular mechanisms affecting postpartum Ca concentration. Then, we assessed the prediction of postpartum Ca concentration using genomic information. Data consisted of 7,691 records of plasma or serum concentrations of Ca measured in the first, second, and third day after parturition of 959 primiparous and 1,615 multiparous cows that calved between December 2015 and June 2020 in 2 dairy herds. All cows were genotyped with 80k SNPs. The statistical model included lactation (1 to 5+), calf category (male, females, twins), and day as fixed effects, and season-treatment-experiment, animal, and permanent environmental as random effects. Model predictive ability was evaluated using 10-fold cross-validation. Heritability and repeatability estimates were 0.083 (standard error = 0.017) and 0.444 (standard error = 0.028). The association mapping identified 2 major regions located on Bos taurus autosome (BTA)6 and BTA16 that explained 1.2% and 0.7% of additive genetic variance of Ca concentration, respectively. Interestingly, the region on BTA6 harbors the GC gene, which encodes the vitamin D binding protein, and the region on BTA16 harbors LRRC38, which is actively involved in K transport. Other sizable peaks were identified on BTA5, BTA2, BTA7, BTA14, and BTA9. These regions harbor genes associated with Ca channels (CACNA1S, CRACR2A), K channels (KCNK9), bone remodeling (LRP6), and milk production (SOCS2). The gene-set analysis revealed terms related to vitamin transport, calcium ion transport, calcium ion binding, and calcium signaling. Genomic predictions of phenotypic and genomic estimated breeding values of Ca concentration yielded predictive correlations up to 0.50 and 0.15, respectively. Overall, the present study contributes to a better understanding of the genetic basis of postpartum blood Ca concentration in Holstein cows. In addition, the findings may contribute to the development of novel selection and management strategies for reducing periparturient hypocalcemia in dairy cattle.", "year": 2021, "openAccessPdf": {"url": "http://www.journalofdairyscience.org/article/S0022030221009838/pdf", "status": "GOLD"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "71649943", "name": "L.

Heritability (h2) was .07 +/- .03 for single observations and .34 +/- .18 for the mean of 7.9 estrous cycles per heifer. Estimated repeatability (r) of ovulation rate was less than or equal to h2, indicating negligible permanent environmental effects. Expected h2 for mean ovulation rate (assuming h2 = r = .07 for single observations) for increasing numbers of estrous cycles would be as follows: 4, .23; 6., 31; 8, .38; and 10, .43. About 50% of the heifers produced no multiple ovulations, but 27% produced multiple ovulations in more than 15% of their estrous cycles. Ovulation rate varied seasonally and increased about .01 per month of age (P less than .05). Genetic correlation of mean ovulation rate with adjusted 368-d weight was low (.08 +/- .32). Ovulation rate in postpartum cows was higher (P less than .05) in fall than in spring (1.15 vs 1.08). In postpartum cows, estimated h2 = .24 +/- .13 and r = .17. Mean ovulation rate for postpartum cows was 1.12 vs 1.09 in puberal heifers, accounting in part for the higher h2. Pregnancy rate was higher (P less than .05) in multiple- than in single-ovulating cows. Effects of ovulation rate on embryonic survival were small (P greater than .05). Unilateral and bilateral multiple ovulations were not different in embryonic survival. Accuracy of ovulation rate determination by palpation per rectum was lower in multiple- than in single-ovulating postpartum cows, because some unilateral multiple corpora lutea, especially, were recorded as singles.

The objectives of our study were to obtain prevalence estimates for RTD diagnosed by 2 methods (PVD and UE scoring) and to investigate the risk factors for increased probability of RTD if these methods are used in isolation or in combination. Our retrospective observational cohort study tested the hypothesis that RTD assessed by 2 methods would have similar risk factors, and that those would be mainly cow- and calving-related factors. We analyzed data from 5,049 pre-breeding examinations (PBE) from 2,460 spring-calved cows on 8 farms between 2014 and 2018. Cow-related details assessed were days in milk at PBE, breed, lactation number, dry period length, body condition score at calving and PBE, 305-d milk yield, predicted transmitting ability for production and fertility, the presence of a corpus luteum at PBE, and positive diagnosis the previous year. Calving details assessed were type of sire, calf sex, twinning, stillbirth, calving difficulty score, and retained fetal membranes. We conducted statistical analyses using 4 multivariable logistic regression models to identify the risk of RTD diagnosed by (1) PVD in isolation, (2) UE in isolation, (3) the presence of either PVD or UE; and (4) the presence of both PVD and UE. We accounted for herd, cow, and year as random effects in all 4 models. The overall prevalence of RTD in models 1, 2, 3, and 4 were 7.5, 6.7, 11.6, and 2.6%, respectively. Days in milk at PBE, the interaction between days in milk and retained fetal membranes, twinning, and the predicted transmitting ability for calving interval were consistently significant risk factors for positive scores in all 4 models. Considerable calving difficulty [adjusted odds ratio (AOR) = 13.64], Holstein Friesian dam breed (AOR = 2.58), first lactation (AOR = 2.39), and body condition score at PBE (AOR = 1.64) were risk factors for a positive PVD score but not for a positive UE score. Fifth lactation (AOR = 1.69), a beef-sired calf (AOR = 1.46), and the absence of a corpus luteum at PBE (AOR = 1.57) were risk factors for a positive UE score but not for a positive PVD score.

They are dwarf in size and noted to be famous for their adaptability, fertility, prolificacy, delicacy of meat and superior skin quality (Husain et al. 1996). It is well adapted to hot and humid climate and usually produces twins and triplets. However, it has been observed that there exists sizeable genetic variation with the traits between individuals within and between locations (Amin et al. 2000). These variations can be exploited for genetic improvement using selective breeding within the breed (Husain et al. 1996; Akhter et al. 2000). But it is a matter of great concern that unlike cattle, goat raisers castrate almost all of their male kids at their early age. Consequently, availability of breeding bucks become squeezed day by day (Amin, 1999). Therefore, provision of Artificial Insemination (AI) using selected buck semen is the easiest Semen from six adult male Black Bengal goats (Capra hircus) was collected to compare the fresh and frozen-thawed semen quality and investigate its relationship with the fertility. Each collected samples was divided into two parts: One part of semen was used as fresh and another part was filled into 0.50 ml straws, sealed, cooled (5 \u030aC) and equilibrated for freezing. In both cases, semen was diluted with commercial Triladyl diluent (a Tris based diluter). The motility and morphology of fresh and frozen-thawed semen was subjectively evaluated by one operator. It was revealed that motility and sperm abnormality of the frozen semen differed significantly (P<0.05), but differed insignificantly in fresh semen between males. Besides these, fresh and frozen-thawed sperm motilities also differed significantly (P<0.01) between males which varied from 70.83\u00b11.54 to 74.23\u00b11.59% and 44.17\u00b12.39 to 52.31\u00b11.08%, respectively. A significantly (P<0.01) higher sperm abnormalities was observed in frozen-thawed semen (11.18\u00b10.42 to 16.55\u00b10.09%) than that of fresh semen (8.82\u00b10.24 to 9.71\u00b10.52%). Cervical inseminations were performed with fresh and frozen-thawed semen in 997 and 1004 female goats, respectively, both at Nucleus Breeding Flock (NBF) and four project areas. Fresh semen showed significantly (P<0.01) higher kidding rates (59.8%) than that with frozen-thawed semen (43.9%). The motilities of fresh and frozen-thawed semen were positively correlated (0.526 and 0.987; P<0.01), whereas the proportion of morphologically abnormal spermatozoa was negatively correlated (-0.530 and -0.776) with fertility of Black Bengal goats. Males with a higher motility and lower proportion of abnormal spermatozoa provided better fertility.", "year": 2012, "openAccessPdf": null, "authors": [{"authorId": "6257597", "name": "A.

The clinical manifestations include primary infertility and pregnancy loss during the late embryonic/early fetal period (30\u201350 days post-AI). This work provides a clinical overview of the current understanding of luteal deficiency and its association with low fertility in dairy cows. Abstract Luteal deficiency is defined as reduced progesterone (P4) steroidogenesis by the corpus luteum (CL), either in the amount or duration, or both. This work provides a clinical overview of the current understanding of luteal deficiency and its association with low fertility in dairy cows. Low plasma P4 concentrations during the luteal phase post-artificial insemination (AI) are associated with lower conception rates. Treatments post-AI with P4, gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) or human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) improve fertility in some conditions. Sub-luteal function during the late embryonic period (at pregnancy diagnosis, i.e., 28\u201334 days post-AI), is just one factor among other factors associated with pregnancy loss. Treatment with P4 in cows with one CL favors pregnancy maintenance, while GnRH treatment does the same in cows carrying twins. The diagnosis of sub-luteal function can be made clinically on the basis of plasma or milk P4 concentrations. Automated in-line milk P4 analysis systems to diagnose luteal activity emerge as a very interesting tool in dairy herds. Monitoring plasma or milk P4 concentrations with the help of Doppler ultrasonography to assess the CL function would allow individualizing the luteal phase support.", "year": 2022, "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://www.mdpi.com/2076-2615/12/15/1871/pdf?version=1658478336", "status": "GOLD"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "1398071649", "name": "F.

Carcass composition", "abstract": "Sibs of five to 11 twin pairs each of five breeds were either slaughtered as veal or as yearling bulls. Highly significant breed differences were evident in the carcass tissue proportions which could be explained on the basis of differences in the physiology of dairy and dual-purpose animals, the former depositing more fat and more bone than dual-purpose breeds. Among the dual-purpose breeds the carcasses of the Pinzgauer (Pi) tended to rank between the carcasses of the Fleckvieh (FV), Braunvieh (BV), Grauvieh (GV) and those of the Friesian (Fr). The dual-purpose breeds FV, BV, GV had more meat in the hindquarter and in the shoulder than the FR while these in turn had more meat in the brisket and in the flank and shank muscles. Again the Pi group tended to rank between the aforementioned groups. Within breeds, large differences between twin pairs indicated high heritabilities for carcass tissue proportions and ratios. The heritability of commercial cut proportions was fairly high but the genetic variance was small, the genetic coefficient of variation being less than 0-02. The different degrees of sexual maturity and of carcass maturity also caused differences in the distribution of meat in the carcasses of young male animals. Significant mean squares for interactions between treatments and breeds, and genetic correlations of less than unity between performance of twin genotypes in veal and in bulls, indicated age and/or rearing system by genotype interactions between and within breeds for various slaughter traits. Phenotypic correlations between various slaughter traits were low except where part-whole relationships were involved.

Davies has brought the Black Sea steppe back into the mainstream of history writing on early modern Europe. In this fluently written and deeply researched study, Davies examines the strategic, operational, and social dimensions of warfare along the northern coasts of the Black Sea from the early sixteenth century through the campaigns of Peter the Great. Davies's book is less self-consciously conceptual than William McNeill's classic Europe's Steppe Frontier (1964) nor does it attempt the daring interpretations offered by Mikhail Khodarkovsky's Russia's Steppe Frontier (2002). But Davies's finely crafted book brings to life an era of interstate conflict, slavetrading, frontier-crossing, and early empire-building that has often fallen victim to the nationalist historiographies of eastern and central Europe. One gleans from it a sense of the western steppe as a genuine place in its own right, not an empty \"wild field\" occasionally traversed by Tatar-Mongol horsemen or Polish-Lithuanian infantry. It challenges historians to imagine the region not as a frontier\u2014now something of a cliche\u2014but rather as a zone of intense cultural interactions, where the people living in cities, towns, villages, and encampments became experts in the art of navigating multiple political, economic, and military environments. Davies is particularly good on the mechanics of warfare. Two finely drawn maps illustrate the defensive lines erected by Muscovy to discourage Tatar raids, as well as the well-worn routes through Moldova, Podolia, and Zaporozhia followed by both Tatar raiders and, in earlier and later periods, Italian, Slavic, and Jewish traders and cattle-drovers. Ambitious sons of Polish-Lithuanian magnates went to war arrayed in leopardskin pelisses, with enormous, feather-encrusted wings sprouting from their backplates. Ottoman and Tatar cavalry attacks challenged Muscovites to develop better stationary defenses for military outposts. Don Cossacks provided usable but inconstant partners to Muscovite armies by adapting the fighting techniques of their Tatar neighbors. The grand themes of Davies's volume are the twin military-political imperatives of patron-seeking and client-making. Over the two centuries surveyed here, the steppe zone became the object of rival states and empires, none of which had sufficient economic or military power to claim it fully as their own. Local elites sold their services to distant and willing patrons, who provided tribute or privileged trading relationships. In time, however, empires sought to recast these relations as imperial hierarchies, picking some local notables over others and transforming them into bearers of the imperial imprimatur. Both processes were always fraught, however. For the Ottomans, the khans of Crimea and the other beys of the northern littoral were a useful brake on Polish-Lithuanian and Muscovite ambitions, yet their slave-raiding continually threatened to drag the Ottomans into new and undesirable wars. The Don and Zaporozhian Cossacks served a similar purpose for Lithuanians and Muscovites, yet their actions could disrupt advantageous trade networks that crossed both steppe and sea. In the transition from principalities, khanates, beyliks, hordes, and kingdoms toward modern empires, warfare was a constant feature of social life, as annual campaigning seasons provided both income for and threats to local societies. In clear prose and with an expert eye for the telling detail, Davies shows how strategy, trade, and military innovation interacted to transform the Black Sea hinterlands.", "year": 2010, "openAccessPdf": null, "authors": [{"authorId": "103959252", "name": "Willard Sunderland"}]}

The child underwent a cholangiopancreatography that caused the release of parasitic material microscopically identified as Fasciola hepatica. All children and their mother were submitted to coproparasitological analyses, which identified F. hepatica eggs only in the patient and in her twin sister. Parasitic materials recovered and flatworm specimens by us ad hoc obtained from Italian and Romanian cattle were genetically (ITS and COI genes) analyzed, and their sequences were compared with those deposited in GenBank. Specimens from children clustered with the Romanian strain examined and showed remarkable genetic differences with flatworm specimens from Italy. Anamnesis, parasite biology, and genetic data strongly suggest that twin sisters became infected in Romania; however, human fasciolosis is an emerging sanitary problem, favored by climate changes and global drivers; therefore, it deserves more attention on behalf of physicians working in both developing and developed countries.", "year": 2014, "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://downloads.hindawi.com/journals/tswj/2014/417159.pdf", "status": "GOLD"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "145277444", "name": "S.

J. Browne\u2019s last lecture before his retirement from the Chair of Obstetrics and Gynaecology at University College Hospital, London. Although only in my first year as a clinical student, and not yet doing obstetrics, this was an occasion not to be missed. F. J. was tall, almost gaunt, slightly stooped, with receding silver grey hair, a high forehead, prominent nose, slightly bulging eyes and a moustache. He spoke with a soft Irish accent. He was wearing a long white coat. The lecture theatre was packed. He lectured without notes on postpartum haemorrhage, covering the subject in a masterly manner. His body language, bearing and diction achieved close communication with his audience. This was in marked contrast to some other distinguished lecturers, who read from their notes without acknowledging their audience, attracting their interest or conveying the fascination of the subject. F. J. was born on 1 October 1879 at Tullybogly, County Donegal, a minute and very isolated community of three farm cottages, stables, cowsheds and barns, 8 miles from Letterkenny and 25 miles west of Londonderry, the location difficult to find and, with no church or pub, too small to be called a village. The rolling countryside was beautiful, with rich dark productive soil, ideal for raising cattle, growing corn, potatoes and flax. The family house wasmodest, singlestoreyed with small rooms and seemed too small for a large family. The nearest church is at Manorcunningham, where there is an impressive memorial erected by F. J.\u2019s father, William Browne, in honour of his parents and other family members. William, a farmer like his father, was tall, straightbacked and bearded with grey eyes and always impeccably dressed. He and his wife Sarah had eight children, of whom F. J. was the fourth. His oldest brother, William, became an engineer in Renfrew. Sam and John emigrated to the Antipodes as sheep farmers, but John returned to Tullybogly when his mother died to look after his old father and the property. After John\u2019s death the house was sold to the parents of the present owners whom I met, as well as a neighbour who remembered the Browne children well. F. J. had four sisters: Mathilda and Sadie became nurses, Elizabeth married a store-keeper from Manorcunningham: they had twin sons, one of whom, Gerald Wallace, I met; and finally Ruby, the youngest, died of tuberculosis aged 10. F. J. first went to Baleighan Primary school\u2014now derelict but beautifully situated on the banks of Lough Swilly. It is close to the home of Mary Gallagher, F. J.\u2019s first wife. Her family, obviously better off than the Brownes, lived in a beautiful house at Ballyeeghan on the shores of the Lough, with large well-proportioned rooms, extensive gardens and grass banks sloping to the water. At the age of 12, F. J. went to Raphoe Royal School, about 7 miles from Tullybogly. Newly opened in 1892, the school was co-educational with 20 pupils. By 1898 numbers had increased to 73 . F. J.\u2019s father gave him a pony and trap for his school journey. A few days before his 17th birthday F. J. entered Foyle College in Londonderry, where he stayed for the next 5 years. Housed in a commanding position overlooking the Foyle River, the College had an impressive staff which included four Cambridge MAs (two of them wranglers), a gold medallist from Trinity College, Dublin and graduates from other English and Irish universities. It deservedly had the reputation of being one of the best schools in Ireland. F. J. was a day-boy and made the daily journey by the newly built Lough Swilly Railway. Later in 1946, as President of the Old Boys Association, he endowed a Memorial Prize for literature. He himself was particularly fond of Shakespeare and poetry in general. The prize is still awarded annually. His friend, Charles McAfee, later Professor in Belfast, also became President of the Association.", "year": 2004, "openAccessPdf": null, "authors": [{"authorId": "40041726", "name": "H. Reiss"}]}

The anomalies statistically associated with twin births are due to the re-arranged embryos of the monozygotics. Common knowledge further requires that dizygotic pairs are dichorionic; monochorionicity is exclusive to monozygotic pairs. These are fundamental certainties in the literature of twin biology. Multiple observations contradict those common knowledge understandings. The double ovulation hypothesis of dizygotic twinning is untenable. Girl-boy twins differ subtly from all other humans of either sex, absolutely not representative of all dizygotics. Embryogenesis of dizygotic twins differs from singleton development at least as much as monozygotic embryogenesis does, and in the same ways, and the differences between singletons and twins of both zygosities represent a coherent system of re-arranged embryogenic asymmetries. Dizygotic twinning and monozygotic twinning have the same list of consequences of anomalous embryogenesis. Those include an unignorable fraction of dizygotic pairs that are in fact monochorionic, plus many more sharing co-twins' cells in tissues other than a common chorion. The idea that monozygotic and dizygotic twinning events arise from the same embryogenic mechanism is the only plausible hypothesis that might explain all of the observations.", "year": 2009, "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://academic.oup.com/humrep/article-pdf/24/6/1255/9549230/dep030.pdf", "status": "BRONZE"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "6583288", "name": "C.

Queenstown and the Tambookie location were established as twin colonial projects at the end of the seventh frontier war. While the location evolved as a prototype experiment in peasant agriculture and freehold tenure, the white town provided a locus for settler colonial commerce and magisterial control over the district that encompassed the Tambookie location. Both projects were creations of frontier conflict, and tensions simmered. Boers coveted the land granted to Africans in the district, and residents of Queenstown struggled to align their dependence on indigenous people with their desire to distance themselves from them. African inhabitants of the Tambookie location chafed at their confinement in a tiny corner of the vast territory from which they had been routed. In 1856\u201367, the episode known as the Great Cattle Killing shifted economic power relations and created a new dependence on the white colonists. Making use of this vulnerability in the mid 1860s, colonial authorities attempted to relocate Africans further away from Queenstown in order to free up land for further colonial settlement. When this strategy failed, they fell back on the hope of drawing Africans into settler capitalist development, and began tinkering with the system of land tenure, imposing taxes and appointing compliant headmen. Tensions exploded in 1877, when the Queenstown magistracy clashed with Gungubele, setting in motion the final tragic showdown between the colonists and the Tambookie location. The moment came to define the hardening character of settler colonialism on the north-eastern frontier and inexorably altered relations both within African society and between colonist and colonised.", "year": 2014, "openAccessPdf": null, "authors": [{"authorId": "79999848", "name": "A.

Four pairs of identical twin Japanese black cows (A, B pairs at 5 years old and C, D pairs at 3 years old) were kept under the same feeding and environmental conditions. OPU was performed for these cows once a week for seven continuous weeks. OPU was done by using a 7.5-MHz linear transducer with needle (17 G, 530-mm length) connected to an ultrasound scanner (SSD-1200, ALOKA, Tokyo, Japan). Oocytes were evaluated by their cumulus cell morphology, cytoplasmic color, and density. To assess the development, collected COCs were cultured for 20\u2009h in TCM-199 supplemented with 5% calf serum (CS) in a microdroplet (volume was adjusted to 5\u2009\u03bcL/oocyte) at 38.5\u00b0C under atmosphere of 5% CO2 in air. After maturation, the COCs were inseminated with frozen-thawed semen collected from the same ejaculation of a single bull. The fertilization was performed with BO solution as described by Imai et al (J. Vet. Med. Sci., 2002, 64(10), 887\u2013891). The zygotes were then cultured in CR1aa supplemented with 5% CS under the same condition of maturation for nine days. Embryo development was assessed by the cleavage rate on Day 2 and the blastocyst production rate on Days 7 to 9 (insemination day\u2009=\u2009Day 0). Blastocysts were classified according to the IETS creteria. Data were analyzed by ANOVA. A total 56 sessions of OPU were performed in this study. The overall mean number of developing follicles (larger than 2\u2009mm in diameter), collected oocytes, and produced blastocysts were 30.3\u2009\u00b1\u20099.2, 20.1\u2009\u00b1\u20099.2 and 6.3\u2009\u00b1\u20093.8 (mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009SD) per session, respectively. The mean number of developing follicles on the day of OPU were significantly different between B and D pairs (38.6\u2009\u00b1\u20097.5 and 21.9\u2009\u00b1\u20096.5, P\u2009<\u20090.01); however, no significant difference was found within each twin. In oocyte quality, C and D pairs were significantly higher grade than the A pair. The percentages of cleaved oocytes and embryos developed to the blastocyst stage (34\u2009\u00b1\u200916, 27\u2009\u00b1\u200910, 41\u2009\u00b1\u200917 and 39\u2009\u00b1\u200924) showed no differences among 4 pairs and within each twin. However, the percentage of Grade 1 blastocyst of B pair was significantly lower (P\u2009<\u20090.01) than that of other pairs, and C pair was significantly higher (P\u2009<\u20090.05) than that of A and D pairs (67\u2009\u00b1\u200925, 41\u2009\u00b1\u200922, 93\u2009\u00b1\u200910 and 71\u2009\u00b1\u200925; A, B, C and D pairs, respectively).

Survival of singles was 13% higher (P < .01) than that of twins at birth, and the difference in survival in favor of singles was of similar magnitude at 72 h (12.9%, P < .01), 150 d (14.8%, P < .01), and 200 d (15.2%, P < .01). Survival of calves with no dystocia was higher than survival of calves with dystocia: 8.6% (P < .01) at birth, 10.8% (P < .01) at 72 h, 12% (P < .01) at 150 d, and 12.2% (P < .01) at 200 d. The effect of dystocia on survival was greater (P < .01) in twins than in singles at birth and at 72 h. Least squares means for dystocia were 20.4% in singles compared with 42.2% in twins. Most of the dystocia in singles resulted from a traction requirement (84.7%) of normal presentations, whereas most of the dystocia in twins (77.8%) resulted from malpresentations, with 59.2% of the malpresentations accompanied with a requirement for traction. Survival in singles ranged from 10.7% to 15.3% greater than in twins at different ages when there was no requirement for assistance in either singles or twins.

Pregnancy rates on D30 were lower in TAI (104/201, 51.7%) than TAI+TET group (126/186, 67.7%) after no HD (Experiment I), but were similar between TAI (32/45, 71.1%) and TAI+TET (30/44, 68.2%) groups after HD (Experiment II).Twinning rates were lower in TAI groups with no HD (6/97, 6,2%) and after HD (1/30, 3,3%) than TAI+TET groups with either no HD (41/125, 32,7%) or with HD (13/30, 40,7%). Overall pregnancy outcomes were similar between groups after the end of the breeding season, being 90.0% (181/201) and 90.3% (168/186) for TAI and TAI+TET with no HD, and 84.4% (38/45) and 84.1% (37/44) for TAI and TAI+TET after HD. Pregnancy losses were higher after TAI+TET with no HD (27/126, 21.4%) than TAI+TET after HD (3/30, 10.0%), and TAI with (2/32, 6.3%) or without (9/104, 8.7%) HD, with no differences observed in losses between singletonand twin-bearing pregnancies. The TAI+TET group after HD had higher number of fetuses per served (0.89) or per pregnant (1.44) female than TAI+TET with no HD (0.69 or 1.30,", "year": 2018, "openAccessPdf": null, "authors": [{"authorId": "153723738", "name": "German Holguin Sanabria"}]}

Pregnancy rate at 30 and 60 days, parturition rate, occurrence of retained placenta and dystocia, and calf weight both at birth and at 30 days of age were evaluated. The double transfer of embryos improved the pregnancy rate at 30 and 60 days of gestation (p<0.05). Heifers that received two embryos stood out in the pregnancy rate at 60 days and in the parturition rate (p<0.05). Calves from recipients that received two embryos were born lighter (p<0.05).

The study aimed to identify SNPs on Indonesian cattle breeds and analyze their genetic diversity using Bovine 50K SNP chip. Twenty eight \"Ongole Grade\" (OG) beef cattle and 20 \"Holstein Friesian\" (HF) dairy cattle were used for the Infinium II assay test. This assay included amplification of genomic DNA, fragmenta-tion, precipitation, resuspension, hybridization, processing bead chip for single-base extension, and imaging at iScan. Data and clusters were analyzed using GenomeStudio software. The Bovine 50K SNP chip containing 54,609 SNPs was observed spanning all chromosomes of bovine genome. Genotyping for the total SNPs was successfull based on Call Rate, GeneCall and GeneTrain scores. Most SNP markers had alleles that shared among the individuals or breeds, or had specific alleles at distinctive frequencies. Minor allele frequency (MAF) spreads equally with intervals of 0-0.5. The breeds of OG and HF tended to be separated in different clusters without considering their genetic history and twin or normal. This result suggests that most individuals are closely related to one another, regardless of the same breed. Some genes identified on chromosomes 3, 4, 5, 7, 13, 17 and 18 were located in the loci/regions that contained SNPs with specific alleles of either HF or OG breed. These SNPs were more powerful for differentiation of beef cattle and dairy cattle than among individuals in the same breed.

The present study was designed to evaluate the significance of ultrasound as well as markers of negative energy balance for the diagnosis of pregnancy toxemia in Barki sheep. A total of seven apparently healthy Barki sheep, in late stage of pregnancy, were subjected to daily clinical examination. Of all ewes, six animals completed the study. The selected ewes were exposed to feed-restriction for five consecutive days to induce a state of negative energy balance. Serum and urine samples were collected on the day before feed-restriction (day 0) and then daily for the next five days. The collected serum samples were analyzed for glucose, cholesterol, triglyceride, beta-hydroxyl butyrate (BHBA), Non-esterified fatty acids (NEFA), insulin and leptin. Urine samples were also tested for the presence of ketone bodies using reagent strips. In parallel, 5-MHz linear and convex transducer was used to examine the liver and associated structures at different time points of the study. All ewes showed no detectable clinical findings throughout the study period. Biochemical analyses showed significant decrease in serum values of glucose and cholesterol with a significant increase (p\u02c20.05) in values of triglyceride, BHBA, NEFA and insulin, while values of leptin showed no significant difference. Ketone bodies were also negative in the urine of all examined animals throughout study period. Ultrasonographic findings showed a significant increase (P\u02c2 0.05) in the mean liver size at the 3 rd day of feed-restriction and onward as compared with day 0, while the highest value was at the 5 th day of feed-restriction. However, the other ultrasonographic liver measurements did not show any significant variations. The diameter of portal vein and caudal vena cava were significantly decreased (P\u02c2 0.05) at the 3 rd day of feed-restriction and ongoing as compared with day 0. There were also a focal hyper echogenic areas in the liver parenchyma observed at the 5 th day of feed-restriction .It can be concluded that ultrasonography as well as metabolic profile could be used as an adjunctive tool for the diagnosis of negative energy balance in Barki sheep.

Health, 2 (2):265-281 (2016) On line ISSN: 2536-9164. 566 Introduction Barki sheep, which dominate the north western desert of Egypt with population of 470,000 heads (11% of the total Egyptian sheep population) are known to be well \u2013adapted to the desert harsh conditions and scarce vegetation (El-Wakil et al., 2008) including poor feeding, heat stress and disease. Barki ewes produced about 40.6 kg of milk; in a lactation period of 18 weeks (El-shahat, 1970).The basic information on their body conformation is available (Ragab and Ghoneim, 1961).However, the major information regarding the genetics of their body weight growth is still lacking. Pregnancy toxemia (gestational ketosis), caused by a negative energy balance, is commonly observed in ewes and goats in the late gestation period (Henz et al., 1998; Rock, 2000; Van Suan, 2000andKulcsar et al., 2006).During pregnancy, fetuses often have a large glucose demand that is satisfied by the mother. If the fetal demand and the mother supply become imbalanced due to fasting of the mother or increased nutritional demands of the rapidly developing fetal placental unit, the females could suffer from a negative energy balance thereby causing a severe hypoglycemia (Batchelder et al., 1999 and Dalrymple, 2004). Ovine pregnancy toxemia develops frequently during the last 4 to 6 weeks of gestation, primarily in pregnancies with more than one fetus, about 60% of fetal growth takes place in this last gestation period. Besides, approximately 33 to 36% of the circulating glucose is directed to the fetoplacental unit in order to satisfy its energetic demands (Hay et al., 1983). Hyperketonemia usually develops when, for yet, the capacity of maternal endogenous glucose production cannot cope with the increased demand of glucose, which is present in the pregnant ewe. Goats suffering from pregnancy toxemia become anorexic, depressed and recumbent and some affected animals become constipated, grind their teeth, and have acetone smell to their breath and suffering from dystocia. Neurologic signs include blindness, circling, in-coordination, stargazing, tremors and convulsions. Death can occurred if the case is left untreated (Pough, 2002). Hyperketonemia and hypoglycemia are more common obvious biochemical features. The main ketone bodies in the blood are acetoacetate and \u03b2-hydroxybutyrate. Most of the acetoacetate produced by the liver is reduced to \u03b2-hydroxybutyrate by hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase enzyme accounting for the higher blood concentration of \u03b2hydroxybutyrate (Grohn et al., 1983). Pregnancy toxemia in sheep is a major metabolic disorder of energy metabolism. It occurs because of a decline in the plane of nutrition, especially in ewes carrying twins or triplets in the last month of pregnancy (Rock, 2000 and Radostits et al., 2007). Failure to identify and separate ewes bearing twins or triplets, over fat condition, prolonged starvation, intercurrent diseases, and stress are Egypt. J. Chem. Environ. Health, 2 (2):265-281 (2016) On line ISSN: 2536-9164. 562 known to predispose the pregnant ewes to this disorder (Rock, 2000; Radostits et al., 2007 and Sargison, 2007). Ultrasonographic diagnosis of pregnancy has gained great attention due to its ability to diagnose the early pregnancy which has been known as important reproductive management practice in sheep flocks (Bazer et al ., 2007 and Ganaie et al., 2009). It has been shown that the energy deficits often results in pregnancy toxemia in ewes and does particularly during the late stage of pregnancy (Pugh and Baird, 2012).The diseases often follow a state of negative energy balance with subsequent impaired gluconeogenesis, hypoglycemia, fat mobilization, ketonemia, and finally ketonuria (Rook, 2000).When hepatic uptake of lipids exceeds its oxidation and secretion, the excess lipids are stored in the liver as tricycle glycerol resulting in fatty liver syndrome with subsequent reduction of hepatic functions. The severe cases of fatty liver can be subdivided into non-encephalopathic severe liver and hepatic encephalopathy (Bobe et al., 2004).The tentative diagnosis of pregnancy toxemia is usually based on a competent history, clinical findings and the characteristic alterations of serum biochemical analyses. In general, ultrasonographic examination has been considered as one of the most important principle imaging techniques used in veterinary practice. It can permit the clinician to gain instant information about a wide variety of body systems and in some cases; the dynamic function of organs can be evaluated. It has been used previously for the examination of the liver in healthy conditions (Braun and Steininger, 2011) and in several pathological conditions encompassing fatty liver in goats (Gonenci et al., 2003), hepatic abscesses in cattle (Abdelaal et al., 2014) and hydatid cyst in sheep (Guarnera et al., 2001; Hussein and Elrashidy, 2014).The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the significance of ultrasound as well as markers of metabolic profile for the diagnosis of experimentally induced negative energy balance in Egyptian Barki sheep. Materials and Methods Animals and feeding and management: A total of seven apparently healthy Barki sheep, of similar ages (mean: 4.2 years, range: 3.5-5 years) and body weight in a range of 23 and 36 kg (mean: 29.5 kg), were randomly selected and were subjected to daily clinical examination (Pugh and Baird, 2012). All investigated ewes were naturally mated and the pregnancy was detected 45 days later by using ultrasonography (Samsung Medison SONOACE R3 ultrasound system, Korea). This study was conducted at Mariut Research Station, Desert Research Center, Elamria, Alexandria, Egypt. All the procedures were done with the approval of the Ethical Committee of the Desert Research Center (Egypt).The animals received aprophylactic treatment against internal and external parasite regularly. Animals were housed in semi open shaded pens. The feed Egypt. J. Chem. Environ. Health, 2 (2):265-281 (2016) On line ISSN: 2536-9164. 562 consisted of concentrate ration plus berseem hay (Trifoliumalexantrinum) and rice or wheat straw all the round of the year. The concentrate feed mixture consisted of cottonseed cake, maize, wheat or rice bran, calcium carbonate, and sodium chloride. All ewes fed on 500 gm of concentrate /day at 2 month gestation, increasing to 750 gm/day for the last 4 weeks of pregnancy. The average crude protein was 14 % this mixture was fed once a day and water was available twice daily around noon after feeding and in late afternoon. Rational, natural pasture (green herbage, grass and remnant of plant, barseem and darawa) was fed when available. The induction of a negative energy status: Four weeks prior to parturition, the selected ewes were housed in separated pens containing straw bedding. After a period of two weeks adaptation time, the animals were subjected to feed restriction for five consecutive days to induce a state of negative energy balance according to the method described by Gonzalez et al. (2011 & 2012), while water was offered ad libitum throughout the study period. During the fasting procedure, one of the ewes lambed and hence eliminated from the study so only six ewes completed the study. Blood Sample: Blood samples were collected daily every morning at 10:00 AM. The first sampling was taken before feed restriction (day 0) and continued for 5 consecutive days. Blood samples were collected by the jugular venipuncture without anticoagulant. After centrifugation of the blood, serum was collected and then frozen at -20 0 Cfor 1week and subsequently anal", "year": 2016, "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://ejceh.journals.ekb.eg/article_248059_4f3ff1169952a5af0a0b82e8fc502d52.pdf", "status": "BRONZE"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2106692163", "name": "M.

A perspective towards the history and modernization of retail business in India", "abstract": "The origins of retail in India can be traced in fairs and \u2018mela\u2019s (an Indian word for village events to sell and promote goods) which were held across the country for the twin purpose of trade and entertainment. The retail story silently continued in an unorganized structure across every street and its corner in India till early 80\u2019s. The process of liberalization which started during 80\u2019s brought modern retail into its veracity. But the contemporary retail is only a reevaluation of century old activity of traders selling their produce in a collective arrangement. The paper attempts in tracing out the transformation of traditional formats of fairs and melas into the contemporary retailing in India. The modern format of retail is only a gradual evolution of trade from melas to malls contradicting the general theory of revolution. Introduction The word \u2018Retail\u2019 originated in 1365 as a derivative of the French word \u201cRetailer\u201d meaning \u2018cutting off, clip and divide\u2019. It was only in 1433 when for the first time it was recorded for a meaning of \u2018sale in small quantities\u2019.The history of retail in India dates back to AD 1672 when a month long yearly fair started in Meerut district of UP. Nauchandi mela ,as it is popularly called, is held every year after \u2018holi\u2019 and attracts over a lakh (100,000 in Indian system of numbers) of visitors. It had started with the objective of trading in animals, especially horses. Over a period of time ,cattle trading was complemented by a multiple of activities of religious rituals, commercial, artistic creativity and rural gaiety. For centuries, such fairs and \u2018mela\u2019s have existed across the villages and cities of India. Other than being a source of entertainment, such fairs were held with a specific objective of commerce. Those who produced surplus were given appropriate place to sell their produce. Later on specific mandi\u2019s and gatherings started with sole purpose of trading. The retail business, in its present form, involves all actions complementary to selling goods and services in small quantities to specific customers for ultimate consumption. This is done by organizing the availability of goods and services on a large scale and selling to consumers on a comparatively diminutive size. The retail business can be tagged into two formats, one Nomadic Retailers; these are small time Journal of Business and Retail Management Research (JBRMR) Vol. 4 Issue 2 April 2010 A Journal of the Academy of Business and Retail management (ABRM) 37 vendors who move from one place to another carrying their produce in a cart or a vehicle, sometimes even on their heads selling door to door or on the roadside. Secondly Preset Retailers; as the name denotes have small or big shops either in front or back of their homes, on street corners, or in commercial complexes. The mom and pop stores, kirana stores, kiosks, provision stores are few examples of preset retail stores. Both of these kinds of retailers are now merged and known as unorganized retail. The organized retail on the other hand is one in which the trading activities embark on by licensed retailers, those who are registered for sales tax, income tax, etc. Unorganized retail in India The \u2018Traditional Retail\u2019 or as popularly called \u2018The Unorganized Retail\u2019 undoubtedly dominates the Indian Retail industry. The exemplar; starting with small cabins, hand cart hawkers, pavement vendors to kirana stores, chemists & provision stores, paan-beedi walas and likes of these many exist on every right \u2013 left and corner of the streets in India. Operating in less then 5000 Sq. feet of area the unorganized retailers comprise 96% of total retail space in India. The stock for sales and display depends upon the taste and sense of the owner; rater then demand of customer. The retailers are mostly illiterate or less educated; they charge Maximum retail price and are unable to maintain proper accounts. Mostly of the transactions are cash oriented and credit cards are generally not accepted.

Sixty three farmers from each of the two districts were interviewed. Data were analysed using SPSS computer package. All farmers (100%) practice an extensive production system where sheep graze together with cattle and goats. The majority (61.9%) of the farmers use communal land to graze their animals, and children are the main source (69.0%) of labour. Almost half (50.8%) of the farmers indicated to supplement their sheep with mainly (65.6%) maize bran. Identified constraints to production were diseases, drought, lack of capital, poor markets and extension services, thefts, and predators. A plastic apron was found to be an effective indigenous technique to control mating and practice seasonal breeding. Age at first lambing for the majority of Red Maasai sheep was 13 to 18 months and lambing intervals of 12 to 18 months. Most sheep lambed between October and January. Twinning cases were few (15.9%) indicating a low twinning rate in the population. Breeding rams were selected within flocks, and many farmers (95.2%) preferred seasonal breeding to allow ewes to lamb in the wet season. Disposals were done to get income, remove infertile ewes, and slaughter for food and rituals. Generally, the productivity of Red Maasai sheep was low due to poor husbandry practices.

Therefore, reproductive management has very important role in dairy herds. Any factor causing delay in cows\u2019 pregnancy, due to extending calving interval, directly results in reduction milk production and less number of calves born per cow per year, and ultimately, leading an increase of non-voluntary replacements in the herd (Holtsmark et al. 2008; Sewalem et al. 2008). Many factors affect the reproductive efficiency of dairy cattle such as nutrition system (Garnsworthy et al. 2008; Tallam et al. 2008; Siciliano-Jones et al. 2005), herd management (Olynk and Wolf, 2008; Schefers et al. 2010), estrus synchronization (Moore and Thatcher, 2006; Thatcher et al. 2001), accuracy of estrus detection (Schefers et al. 2010; Moore and Thatcher, 2006), insemination and the skill of inseminator (Lima et al. 2009) and genital disease such as retained placenta (L\u00f3pez-Gatius et al. 2006). Placenta is an organ which connects a developing fetus to the mother's To investigate the effects of certain factors on the rate of retained placenta, 2844 calving records from 1288 Holstein cows in a herd were used. These cows calved during year period of 2001 to 2007. A generalized statistical linear model was applied to analyze the data. Logistic regression model was applied as the statistical model. In the model, fixed effects of year, season (warm or cold) and sex and birth type (single or twin) of calf and parity and gestation length of dam were included. In data file, retained placenta incidence was introduced as binary codes: zero for healthy cows and one for cows with retained placenta and probability of code one was analyzed. Incidence of retained placenta was significantly affected by all the fixed effects included in the model. Odds ratio estimation for cold season compared to warm seasons was 0.619, which means probability of occurrence of this disease in cold season, is 39% less than in the warm season. Odds ratio estimation for female calves in comparison to male calves was 0.6, which implies that the former are 40% less probable to cause retained placenta. Probability of this disease in twin calving was 5.9 times more than singles. By increasing the parity number of the dam, the probability of experiencing retained placenta in cow increased.

This phenomenon is the most fascinating one to transfusiologists, since it is joined to the blood group antigens, erythrocytes and bone marrow derived haemato-, and immunopoietic cells. In 1945 Roy Owen published his basic observation about the cattle disygotic twins which possessed genetically their own red blood cells, but also disparate ones as well, originated from the twin partner in their adult life. He concluded that \u201csome mechanism is operating to produce fiequent phenotypic identity of blood types in genetically dissimilar tweens\u201d. This biological situation may be associated with F.R. Lillie\u2019s observation 10 years earlier about the anatomic anastomosis in cattle twin placentas. Four years later, in 1949, M.F. Bumet and F. Fenner wrote in their monograph highlighting their \u201cself marker hypothesis\u201d, that Owen\u2019s observation is a brilliant example supporting their idea as a unique natural example. As an experimental proof to their hypothesis they suggested the use of foreign red cell inoculation in embryonic age to establish the \u201ctolerance\u201d state. This notion was quoted fiom E. Traub, who described this phenomenon after the inoculation of lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus into the mouse embryo, which became a healthy carrier of the virus lacking specific antibody production as the consequence of tolerance to the microorganism. B. Medawar, separately from the above experimentation, was testing cattle twins by skin grafting to determine their monoor disygotic state. To his greatest astonishment, however, the skin graft from disygotic twins was not rejected. After somebody has drawn his attention to the monograph of M.F. Bumet he realised that the same phenomenon may underlie Owen\u2019s and his own observation. Following the publication of Medawar\u2019s famous result of in 1951, he continued his research in London with R.E. Billingham and L. Brent. They inoculated spleen cells fiom foreign inbred strains to mouse embryo and tested them later by skin grafting in adult life. In consequence of embryonic inoculation the mice failed to reject the graft proving the successful induction of tolerance. Combined with the above described experiments they established chimeric state, too, by using haematopoietic cells for inoculation. In 1960, B. Medawar and M.F. Burnet were awarded the Nobel Prize for their discovery. The following decades resulted in an expansion of these experiments with the inclusion of experimental bone marrow transplantation describing the graft versus host and host versus graft disease and the association between chimerism and tolerance ( 1,2,3). Basic terminology and fundamental conditions of chimerism and tolerance What is chimerism and are there various forms of it? Chimera is a biological organism containing cells or tissues derived from a genetically different individual of the same or divergent species. It is important to know that the chimeric state can be established by Nature termed as spontaneous chimera or as an artificial one by various interventions using foreign cell inoculations or organ transplantation and treatments affecting the haematoand immunopoietic system.

Furthermore, the frequency of congenital anomalies should be\n quantified. Within the scope\n of this study following congenital anomalies were investigated:\n Peromelia\n In a male German\n Brown calf monobrachial peromelia in the right front limb was observed. The malformed\n limb was examined by means of pathological-anatomical and radiographical\n methods. The proximal limb from the shoulder up to the radius and ulna was\n normally developed. Only rudiments of the distal segments of the limb were\n present and at the distal end of the limb there was only one small malformed\n claw. Possible genetic and environmental causes of this rare congenital\n anomaly were discussed in the context of congenital limb anomalies in cattle.\n Polydactyly\n A female German\n Holstein twin calf with polydactyly in the form of an additional medial toe\n in both front limbs and in one of the hind limbs was born. Due to the\n pedigree the affected calf could be reduced on common ancestors. Because a\n monogenic or digenic gene expression was suspected in similar cases, it is\n most probable that the polydactyly is inherited in the present case.\n Syndactyly\n In 8 black and\n white German Holstein calves syndactyly was observed. The number of feet\n affected varied from one, more than one and all four. All syndactylous calves\n could be traced back to a joint ancestor, which was already identified as a\n carrier bull for the mulefoot gene. The pedigree was consistent with a\n monogenic autosomal recessive inheritance and variable expressivity.\n Hyperextension of fetlock joints\n In two different dairy farms 6 calves exhibiting\n bilateral flexion of the fetlock joints in front or rear legs with varying\n occurrence were born. Four of the affected calves from the same farm were\n crossbred between German Holstein cows with red and white coat colour and a\n bull of the breed Limousin. The other two affected calves born on another\n farm were purebred German Holsteins with a black and white coat colour. A\n degeneration of the liver caused the death of the affected crossbred calves.\n The pedigrees support inheritance through a monogenic autosomal recessive\n locus or more recessive gene loci with variable expressivity. However, the\n analysis could not clarify whether different gene loci are responsible for\n the congenital anomalies observed in the calves from the two farms and thus,\n the observed anomalies may be different genetic entities.\n Arthrogryposis associated with facial scoliosis and torticollis\n In 13 German Holstein calves from two different\n dairy farms arthrogryposis of the front legs, facial scoliosis and\n torticollis were observed. A striking feature was the high frequency of\n affected calves among the offspring of one natural service sire. A plausible\n explanation of the congenital anomalies observed is a dominantly inherited\n mutation restricted to germ cells.\n Brachyuria\n In 11 German Holstein\n cattle with black and white or red and white coat colour short tails could be\n observed. The pedigree data showed that all short tailed\n animals were related with each other and this fact provides evidence that\n brachyuria is an inherited congenital anomaly. The pedigree indicated a\n monogenic or oligogenic autosomal recessive inheritance.\n Bilateral\n anophthalmia associated with further anomalies of the head\n Two female calves of the breed German Holsteins\n showing bilateral anophthalmia and deformations of the jaws such as\n brachygnathia superior and bilateral cleft of lips and noses, respectively,\n were born on two different farms. A monogenic autosomal recessive inheritance\n could be considered as genetic cause.\n Bilateral\n anotia\n In a female black and white coloured German\n Holstein calf bilateral anotia and impaired vision was observed. This\n congenital anomaly is very seldomly seen in cattle. No other affected calves\n could be detected by examining the relatives.\n Epitheliogenesis imperfecta\n In 6 German Holstein calves, black and\n white-colored, from a single dairy farm epitheliogenesis imperfecta was\n observed. The affected calves survived only a few days up to some weeks. The\n pedigree of the affected calves suggested a monogenic autosomal recessive\n inheritance. The autosomal recessive defective allele was probably\n disseminated in the cows of this dairy farm through natural service sires.\n Diprosopus\n Three calves of the breeds German Holstein, German\n Angus and German Fleckvieh from three farms were born showing different forms\n of facial duplication. Two calves were classified as diprosopus with\n tetraophthalmus and in one calf a partial duplication of the forehead with a\n third nose was observed. The occurrence of twin births and inbreeding could\n be of importance for the observed congenital anomaly. . Even if the cases of\n diprosopus showed no increased frequency by paternal half sib groups, it is\n likely that diprosopus is genetically influenced and a larger number of genes\n may determine the phenotype.\n Diphallus\n A diphallus was found in a German Holstein calf.\n Clinical examination revealed a duplication of glans penis, corpus penis and urethra.\n Possibly, this congenital anomaly is caused by a chromosomal aberration.\n Investigation of the frequency of congenital\n anomalies in cattle\n The\n study gives a survey of congenital anomalies observed in cattle. On the one\n hand, the data included cases registered in a veterinary practice and on the\n other hand, cases were made available by an AI station (Rinder-Union West,\n RUW). The frequency of malformation found in the area of the RUW was\n estimated 0.013 %. In the veterinary practice a frequency of 0.51 % was\n estimated. The most prevalent anomalies were seen in legs and the spine.\n Arthrogryposes were most frequent among the anomalies of the legs. Further,\n umbilical hernia and atresia of segments of the intestinum were very often\n observed. The frequency of congenital anomalies differed not significantly\n among bulls. A form and a documentation by means of instructive photographs\n to be used for registration of the most prevalent congenital anomalies in\n progeny tests of AI bulls was developed.", "year": 2003, "openAccessPdf": null, "authors": [{"authorId": "2076122637", "name": "C.

Breeding values for twinning were estimated by a single-trait linear animal model.

Females were bred by AI for 40 d followed by 20 or 30 d of natural service with equal numbers bred and calved in spring and fall. Percentage of dams cyclic by the end of the AI period was lower (P<.05) for dams birthing and nursing a single calf (92.4%) than for dams birthing twins and nursing zero (98.7%) or two (94.7%) calves. Whereas the interval from parturition to first estrus was shorter (P<.01) for dams birthing and nursing a single (56.9 d) than for dams birthing twins and nursing one (68.5 d) or two (69.6 d) calves, length of the interval was further reduced by dystocia in nonlactating dams of either twins or singles (type of birth x dystocia, P<.05). Ensuing pregnancy rates were also affected by type of birth and dystocia. Without dystocia, dams birthing and nursing a single calf had a higher pregnancy rate (79.2%) than dams birthing twins and nursing one (61.7%) or two (66.3%) calves, whereas the lower ensuing pregnancy rates associated with dystocia in dams of singles (71.9%) resulted in similar rates among dams of singles and twins with dystocia (type of birth x dystocia; P<.01). Having a retained placenta resulted in a lower incidence of (93.5 vs. 96.4%, with vs. without; P<.05) and a longer interval to (64.7 vs. 59.2 d; P<.01) estrus while reducing subsequent pregnancy rates (X = 9.6%) in 3 of the 7 yr evaluated (retained placenta x year, P<.01). Because all parous females were bred during the same calendrical period, the shorter gestation length for twin calves (275.6 vs. 281.3 d) resulted in a longer interval from parturition to conception for twin births, whereas means for conception date differed by only 2 d between dams of twins and singles. Furthermore, a reduction (P<.01) in the interval to conception occurred with dystocia in dams of singles (89.3 vs. 85.0 d, without vs. with dystocia) and of twins nursed by zero (116.9 vs. 83.5 d), one (100.2 vs. 92.8 d), or two (96.1 vs. 97.2 d) calves. Another detriment to fertility was the higher incidence of fetal mortality or abortions associated with twin vs. single pregnancies (12.4 vs. 3.5%; P<.01).

Groundwater withdrawals during 1980 (latest year for which data are available) in Tom Green County totaled about 15,300 acre-feet, all derived from shallow aquifers. Shallow aquifers in this report refer to the ground-water system generally less than 400 feet deep that contains water with less than a 10,000 milligrams per liter concentration of dissolved solids; aquifers comprising this system include: The Leona, Comanche Peak, Trinity, Blaine, San Angelo, Choza, Bullwagon, Vale, Standpipe, and Arroyo aquifers. The current (1983) water levels in shallow aquifers in Tom Green County are relatively unchanged from those levels listed in previous reports. In most wells, the change in water level is less than 10 feet, and only a few isolated wells or areas have changes of more than 20 feet. Based on long-term hydrographs of selected wells and precipitation, water levels are directly related to precipitation and associated pumpage for irrigation. Current (1983) water levels probably are higher than normal due to the above-normal precipitation during 1980-81. Ground water in Tom Green County commonly is very hard (greater than 180 milligrams per liter as calcium carbonate), and chemical types vary in the aquifers and in different parts of the county. The concentrations of dissolved solids range from 200 to 3,000 milligrams per liter, the dissolved-chloride concentrations range from about 40 to 1,000 milligrams per liter, and the dissolved-sulfate concentrations normally range from about 25 to 600 milligrams per liter. The dissolved-nitrate concentrations in samples from eight wells ranged from 2 to 37 milligrams per liter. Five of these samples exceeded the maximum contaminant level of 10 milligrams per liter set by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. Of the eight water samples analyzed for minor elements, two exceeded the maximum contaminant level for selenium, and one exceeded the maximum contaminant level for manganese. Samples from three wells were analyzed for selected pesticides; no pesticides were detected. Two groups of ground-water samples were tested for bacteria in April and August 1983. The first group consisted of samples from 25 wells; no samples contained fecal-coliform bacteria, but 15 samples contained fecal-streptococci bacteria. The second group consisted of samples from 29 wells and 1 spring; twelve of these samples contained fecal-coliform bacteria and all 30 contained fecal-streptococci bacteria. Water samples from seven wells were common to both groups, and the samples tested in August contained more bacteria. Counts of fecal-coliform bacteria ranged from 0 to 26 colonies per 100 milliliters with most less than 5 colonies per 100 milliliters. Counts of fecal-streptococci bacteria ranged from 0 to 400 colonies per 100 milliliters with most less than 20 colonies per 100 milliliters. The presence of fecal-coliform and fecalstreptococci bacteria in water is only an indicator that pollution from septic systems may be present and is not a positive check for fecal pollution. Generally, the aquifers are not contaminated by septic-system effluent, however, some individual wells or localized areas could be contaminated by nearby septic systems. Using dissolved-solids concentrations as an indicator, historical and current (1983) water-quality records were compared to determine if any changes in water quality had occurred. The quality of water from Cretaceous rocks underlying the Edwards Pleateau has not changed significantly; this water is the least mineralized ground water in the county. The quality of water from the Arroyo and Bullwagon aquifers in the eastern most part of the county also has not changed significantly; dissolved-solids concentrations range from 1,500 to 2,000 milligrams per liter. In the remainder of the county, dissolved-solids concentrations have increased from 10 to 500 milligrams per liter in ground water along the river valleys and in the Li pan Flat area and increases of 500 to 1,100 milligrams per liter have occurred in ground water southeast of San Angelo, west of Twin Buttes Reservoir, and about 10 miles east of San Angelo. Locally, dissolved-solids concentrations have increased by as much as 4,530 milligrams per liter in water from individual wells. Pollution from oil-field activities may affect the quality of water in some isolated wells and in some areas in the county. No historical records are available for determining any changes in pesticides, minor elements, or bacteria. INTRODUCTION In Tom Green County, Texas, ground water is most readily available in the alluvial valley of the Concho River east of the city of San Angelo (fig. 1). In the other areas of the county, ground water generally is limited in quantity, and its quality may vary from fresh to saline. The total area of Tom Green County is 1,547 mi?. About 300 mi 2 is cropland of which about 22 mi 2 is irrigated, and about 1,100 mi 2 is rangeland. Major economic bases of the county are agriculture (sheep, cattle, grain sorghum, cotton, and dairy products), Goodfellow Air Force Base, oil and gas production, manufacturing, and San Angelo State University. The population of the county in 1980 was 84,780 (U.S. Bureau of the Census, 1980) of which 73,240 were residents of San Angelo, the county seat. Demands on the ground-water resources of Tom Green County are expected to continue to increase, and concerns have been expressed regarding the future availability of water and the possible deterioration of the quality of water in the shallow aquifer system. Documentation of existing ground-water conditions for subsequent planning is needed for development, management, and utilization", "year": 1986, "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://pubs.usgs.gov/wri/1986/4177/report.pdf", "status": "BRONZE"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "97850218", "name": "J.

On the other hand, few genes or causative mutations might explain significant genetic variations between animals for the reproductive traits. Studies report different methods, including QTL analysis, fine mapping, GWAS, and MAS selection, to improve such traits due to their economic importance. The recent fine-mapping study, which narrows the genomic region, indeed, influencing multiple ovulation, gives positive signals that causative mutation controlling high ovulation rate may be identified shortly. In conclusion, identifying the major genes that considerably affect ovulation and twinning rates provides the opportunity to increase reproduction efficiency by improving genetic gain in livestock species.", "year": 2021, "openAccessPdf": null, "authors": [{"authorId": "49888846", "name": "O.

In this, cattle are following the path already taken by sheep on the lowlands, where emphasis is on slaughter at younger ages and at lighter weights. It can be expected in beef cattle that steady progress will be made towards cutting out the 'store' period, enabling a more rapid turnover of capital, the production of beef to be more attractive economically and the finished beef animal to be more acceptable to both butcher and consumer. As age of slaughter is reduced by advances in breeding and feeding, fertility must assume even greater importance in the economy of production. The possible economic advantages of twins in beef and dairy cattle under certain conditions of farming in Britain have been already mentioned by some authors (Cooper, 1953;Hammond, 1958,1959). They point out that a major factor operating against specialist beef production in Britain is the high cost of a suitable rearing calf, a cost which can only be borne where beef rearing is secondary to some other farm enterprise such as dairying or sheep. Onecow-one-calf per annum is often not an economic proposition on land which offers alternative and more profitable ways of utilization. An increase in the twinning rate might materially alter the position, for although returns per acre would not be very great, costs, particularly in labour, would be low. For Australian dairying conditions, Lamond & Clark (1960) point to the possibilities of twinning in veal production, where production might be greatly simplified, by allowing the dairy herd to produce calves suitable for veal in addition to the normal herd replacements. Hammond (1958) draws attention to the scope for veal production in British herds, since this might, under appropriate circumstances, give the producer an additional and profitable side-line. Certainly, the feeding conditions and labour available on many British beefrearing farms are adequate for consideration of induced twin-pregnancies in the cow.

Therefore, this trait and the correlated trait of ovulation rate are ideal candidates for marker-assisted selection. The objective of this study was to complete a genome-wide search for ovulation rate quantitative trait loci (QTL) in two related sire families. The families (paternal halfsib sires 839802 and 839803) were from a population of cattle selected for ovulation rate at the USDA Meat Animal Research Center, Clay Center, Nebraska. Putative ovulation rate QTL have previously been identified in the 839802 family on chromosomes 7 and 19; however, marker coverage in the original scan was not complete. This study fills the gaps in marker coverage of the earlier study by adding approximately 60 informative microsatellites to each sire family. Each family was genotyped using selective DNA pooling. Sons and daughters were included in either the high or low pool based on their estimated breeding value deviations from the mid-parent average (EBVMD) for ovulation rate. Approximately 40% (839802) and 26% (839803) of available progeny comprised the high and low pools combined. Pooled typing revealed possible associations (nominal P < 0.05) between ovulation rate and marker genotype for 11 and 15 microsatellites in the 839802 and 839803 families, respectively.

The freemartin phenotype appears in a dizygotic twin pregnancy where one twin is a male and the other is a female. Due to precocious anastomoses between the placental vascular systems of the two fetuses, masculinising molecules reach the female twin and disrupt the normal sexual differentiation, whilst in the male the effects of this association are usually minimal. In cattle, this condition is observed in 90 to 97% of twin pregnancies. A freemartin is, by definition, a genetically female fetus masculinised in the presence of a male co-twin, giving rise to a sterile heifer. Genital tract defects with varying severity can be observed in freemartin animals, which often present suppression and disorganization of the ovary, originating a rudimentary or a testis-like gonad depleted of germ cells. The uterine horns may be hypoplastic or instead may be reduced to a cordlike structure suspended in the broad ligament. Anatomic continuity between the uterus and the vagina is frequently absent, and the existence of rudimentary vesicular glands is typical. The external genitalia commonly presents enlarged clitoris, small vulva and a prominent, male-like tuft of hair. As a rule, heifers born twin to a bull have to be considered sterile and should be identified as early as possible to cull them from replacement stock. Despite its limitations, freemartinism is currently diagnosed by physical examination, as karyotyping or blood typing is often considered an unnecessary expense. In cattle, twinning trend has a genetic background that has been associated to hormonal regulation in favor of double ovulations.

In fact, in dairy animals, in particular in high milk producing cows, it has long been proven that the increase of twin calvings occurs due to the hormonal and metabolic disturbances in the energy balance early in the post-partum period. With increased incidence of twin births in cow it is reasonably expectable a small increase in the occurrence of freemartins at the farm levels.

Results of the experiment showed that without urea the low-fiber rations were generally superior to the high-fiber rations in digestible energy and total digestible nutrients, but when the level of urea in the concentrate mixtures was increased to 40lb per ton, the high-fiber ration fed with early-cut hay was comparable to the low-fiber, more expensive concentrate mixture. The increase was due to a decrease in the heat increment as the urea in the ration was increased. The substitution of urea for protein did not affect the digestible crude protein content of the rations and had no significantly adverse effect on their nutritive values.

This population has been maintained at the US Meat Animal Research Center since 1981 and subjected to selection for twinning rate. Phenotypic records for this population included twinning rate and ovulation rate, providing an opportunity to examine the potential effects of SPP1 genotype on reproductive traits. A set of 2,701 animals was geno-typed for the T(9)/T(10) polymorphism at SPP1. The geno-typic data, including previously genotyped markers on chromosome 6 (BTA6), were used in conjunction with pedigree information to estimate genotypic probabilities for all 14,714 animals with phenotypic records. The genotypic probabilities for females were used to calculate independent variables for regressions of additive, dominance, and imprinting effects. Genotypic regressions were fit as fixed effects in a mixed model analysis, in which each trait was analyzed in a 2-trait model where single births were treated as a separate trait from twin births. The association of the SPP1 marker with birth weight (P < 0.006), weaning weight (P < 0.007), and yearling weight (P < 0.003) was consistent with the previously reported effects of SPP1 genotype on yearling weight.

We have found that some preparations of Escherichia coli endotoxin (phenol and trichloroacetic acid (TCA) extract) are hypothermic while butanol extracts cause a fever. In the present study, diurnal differences in the response to hypo- and hyperthermic varieties of endotoxin (TCA extract, strain 055:Bg, Difco Labs (ED) and b u t d extract, strain 0127:B8 (ES) respectively) were examined by injection into rats adapted to normal and reversed daily lighting cycles. Nutrition and suckling affect reproductive function in cattle (Dunn Edgerton, however, the mechanisms which interrelate those factors remain to be elucidated.

Calves from PLZ and WC groups were removed after the sampling period on day I and kept separate through to day 4, except for a I h sucking period on day 3. Blood was collected at 10-min intervals for 6 h on days I and 4 and serum was assayed for LH concentration. (LH pulse = two consecutive values >40% above basal.) Plasma insulin, glucose and free fatty acid (FFA) concentrations were determined in samples collected every 2 h for 8 h on day I through to day 4; samples for progester-one were collected on days -I, I and 3, and twice weekly for 3 weeks thereafter. the PLZ group mean urinary secretion of 567 (SE 40) g glucose/d compared with <3-0 g/d in the WC and SC groups (P<o.ooI).

The weights of the major tissues and organs were obtained by physical dissection and the chemical constituents were determined on freeze-dried subsamples obtained following the separate mincing of each fetus. Treatment means for the weights of a selection of body organs, muscles and chemical constituents are given in the Table. The flow of nitrogen from isotopic glycine to urea is limited in preterm infants and during the 3rd trimester of pregnancy. We interpreted this as indicating that the large demand for glycine made by the rapidly growing fetus exceeds the ability of the body to produce glycine endogenously. In pyroglutamic aciduria, an inborn error of metabolism (deficiency of glutathione synthase (EC 6.3.2.3)) results in an increased urinary excretion of pyroglutamic acid. We reasoned that limited availability of glycine, as substrate of glutathione synthase, would restrict flow through this enzyme and might thus result in increased urinary excretion of pyroglutamic acid. We have measured the urinary excretion of pyroglutamic acid in non-pregnant and pregnant women in the Ist, 2nd and 3rd trimesters. trimester metabolism. However, we have shown in normal adults that acute depletion of the available glycine pool with oral benzoic acid can give rise to pyroglutamic aciduria. We have found that excretion increases in four different metabolic states in which the demand for glycine is enhanced. These results provide support for the postulate that glycine acts as a semi-essential amino acid, and suggests that the availability of glycine may be limited as pregnancy advances. The excretion of pyroglutamic acid may provide a simple non-invasive index of glycine sufficiency. The shearing of ewes 8 weeks before lambing results in an increased plasma glucose concentration which is most apparent during the final 2 weeks of pregnancy (Symonds et al. 1985). It has been proposed that this response may result in a higher lamb birth weight due to an increased supply of glucose to the fetus. Shearing may induce changes in glucose metabolism either by stimulating hepatic gluconeogenesis or by inhibiting glucose utilization by hind-limb tissues. The aim of the present study was to quantify the effects of shearing on the supply and utilization of glucose by maternal tissues. Five pairs of unshorn (US) and shorn (S) (at 8 weeks before lambing, i.e. 95 d of pregnancy) twin- or triplet-bearing Bluefaced Leicester cross Swaledale ewes were paired with respect to body-weight (62-87 kg). All animals were housed at ambient temperature (-2 to 13.5~) and given, twice daily at 08.30 and 18.00 hours, a diet of barley concentrate and ammonia-treated straw. Catheters were implanted into the carotid artery of all sheep and 8 d later into the femoral vein (~rg-139 d of pregnancy). The next day [U-\"C]- and [6-3H)glucose were infused for a 5 h period starting after the morning feed, followed 4 d later by a 5 h infusion of NaHL4C0,. Four sets of blood samples were taken during the final hour of the isotope infusion. Hind-limb blood flow rates were measured using tritiated water. The research in this and the following two abstracts was designed to look at digestion in and outflow from the rumen in relation to the voluntary intake of hay and silage. the present we the release of luteinizing hormone in anoestrous ewes hypoglycaemic by the infusion of insulin. Genetically obese (ob/ob) mice are larger and fatter, and show several metabolic differences from similarly maintained non-mutant litter mates (Enser, 1972). Using established dissection and adipocyte sizing techniques (Pond et al. 1984), we measured the gross mass and the diameter of about forty adipocytes of the nine largest adipose depots in normal and mutant female mice aged 20 weeks, fed ad lib on normal laboratory chow at 20\u00b0. The site-specific mean adipocyte volume and the cellularity of each depot were calculated using standard formulae (Goldrick, 1967) and taking the density of adipose tissue as 0.9. The mean number of adipocytes per kg body mass in the mutant mice was 2 . 1 8 ~ 1 0 * , which was significantly different (P<o.ooI) from the mean value of 1 . 4 0 ~ 1 0 ' in the normal mice. Although the total adipocyte complement of the mutant mice was 14% greater than that predicted from the allometric relation between adipose tissue cellularity and body mass (Pond & Mattacks, 1985), it was within the range of inter-individual differences in adipocyte complement found in apparently normal wild mammals. Most of the additional adipocytes were in the mesenteric, shoulder, side groin and tail depots. Mean volumes of adipocytes in all depots studied were greater in the mutants than in the controls but, in both strains, adipocytes in the 'under trapezius muscles' depot were smaller, and those in the two inguinal depots larger, than those in the mesentery and in the shoulder and forelimb depots. This pattern of site-specilic differences in adipocyte volume is similar to that described in many other mammalian species (Pond, 1986). Fatness laying reduced energy By An experiment was performed to examine the response of laying hens differing in fatness to dietary regimens which reduced their energy intakes. Abdominal fatness caliper measurements (Rose & Michie, 1983) were taken on 1240 Isa Brown hens at 44 weeks of age. The 432 bkds with the highest and lowest measurements were allocated to 'fat' and 'lean' groups respectively. Dissection of a sample of these birds showed that the caliper measurements were significantly correlated (Y 0.688) to the weight of the abdominal fat as a proportion of live weight. The birds were re-caged into twenty-four experimental units and given one of three dietary treatments for a 24 week peribd: (i) a conventional layer's food (I I .6 MJ metabolizable energy (ME)/kg, 170 g crude protein (nitrogen x 6.25)/kg and 40 g calciudkg) ad lib.; (ii) a lowenergy food ad lib. in which the calculated nutrient composition differed only from the conventional food in ME (10.6 MJ ME/kg); (iii) the conventional food restricted to 133.5 g/bird per d. The fat birds (6.6% abdominal fat) were 220 g heavier than the lean birds (4.2Y0 abdominal fat) at the start of the experiment and this difference increased to 340 g in the ad lib.-fed birds by the end of the experiment. The proportion of abdominal fat increased in both the fat and lean birds given the conventional and low-energy foods ad lib. but remained approximately constant in the layers given the restricted quantity of the conventional food.

Heteropagus or conjoined asymmetric twins can be differentiated into a dominant and a parasitic twin, which can be classified further by the development of the parasitic twin and its anatomical attachment to the dominant twin (autosite). In epigastric heteropagus, the parasitic twin is attached to the autosite in the epigastric area. Epigastric heteropagus is a very rare condition in all species, but it has previously been reported in human beings (Chadha and others 1993). There have been no reports of heteropagus in cattle in Trinidad and Tobago, and there is a paucity of information on bovine epigastric heteropagus in the literature. Reports of congenital abnormalities in Trinidad include craniopagus in a calf (Isitor and Adogwa 1992), perosomus elumbus in a goat (Cazabon and others 1994) and cephalothoracopagus in sheep (Cazabon and Adogwa 2003). The interest in congenital abnormalities lies mainly in the aetiology and its implications, such as genetic defects and environmental toxins. This short communication describes the first case of epigastric heteropagus in cattle reported in Trinidad and Tobago. An abnormal calf (Fig 1) was born in September 2004 by normal delivery to a Holstein cow in Ravine Sable, central Trinidad, and died within 48 hours of birth. The farm used an artificial insemination service, and the farmer grazed his seven cows and one heifer extensively on approximately seven acres of pasture, supplementing their diet with a dairy ration, occasional vitamins/electrolytes and salt licks. Albendazole (Albenzole; Kela) was routinely used on the farm, but no pesticides, fertilisers or herbicides were applied to the pasture, and no pasture control/management strategies were practised. The grasses found in the pasture included guinea grass (Panicum maximum), lacunta (Ischaemumm timorense) and elephant grass (Pennisetum purpureum). The dominant calf was female, fully formed and had no major abnormalities. The parasitic calf had several abnormalities; it consisted of two hindlimbs joined to an abnormal pelvis (Fig 1) and fused forelimbs. The limbs were characterised by arthrogryposis. The forelimb consisted of an abnormal humerus, radius and ulna, and a pair of metacarpal bones that were fused proximally but were separate and distinct distally (Fig 2). The digits were also duplicated. The metacarpal bones were held together by skin and permitted very little movement. All the bones were shorter than normal. Ankylosis of the carpal joint was evident. The distal part of the limb was fixed in a flexed position at the carpus. There were two ulna bones articulating with a single radius between them. The ulna bones were bigger than the radius and the olecranon processes were directed laterally. The radius and ulna were fused to the cranial aspect of the distal humerus. The elbow was ankylosed. The condyles of the humerus (distal end of the humerus) were enlarged (Fig 2). Only the distal half of the humerus was developed, so the arm was short (Fig 2). The scapula was also undeveloped so that the abnormal forelimb was attached by a fold of skin approximately 7 cm wide to the ventral aspect of the thorax in the xiphoid region. Two blood vessels passed through this fold to the limb: one on the cranial aspect and the other on the caudal aspect. The arteries originated in the liver. No nerves were found leading to the forelimb. The pelvic girdle was abnormal (Fig 3). The ileum and the ischium were abnormal and the pubis was absent. The wing of the ilium was not formed and the shaft joined the shaft of the opposite ilium to form a rod-like cranial projection. The ischii of both sides were fused ventrally and joined caudally to form a caudal projection. The ischiatic arch and tuberosity were absent. The obturator foramen was absent but there was FIG 1: Parasitic calf attached to a fully formed female calf in the epigastric area; the parasitic calf comprised two hindlimbs joined to an abnormal pelvis and fused forelimbs", "year": 2006, "openAccessPdf": null, "authors": [{"authorId": "9901502", "name": "R.

The increased dizygotic twinning observed globally since 1970 has been attributed to fertility treatments (ovulation induction and ART) but the striking feature of Newitt et al.\u2019s Figure 1 is the relatively small proportion of twins attributable to ART despite a rapid rise in the number of pregnancies following ART. If all single embryo transfers (SET) were actually double embryo transfers (DET) the number of twins was estimated to be 1000 per 100 000 or half of all twins in ANZ. The adoption of SET in ANZ has occurred without mandate or regulation and has been driven by clinicians, often practising obstetricians, working in an environment where funding of ART is supported by government. Most dizygotic twinning in ANZ is not related to ART. Dizygotic (DZ) twinning is a marker of fecundity of a population and is influenced by increased maternal age, nutrition, genetic constitution and other factors. It is these influences \u2013 particularly deferral of childbearing and improved nutrition \u2013 which have probably provided the major contribution to the rise in DZ twinning seen globally since 1970. The contribution of ovulation induction agents such as clomiphene and low-dose follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) which have twin pregnancy rates of 6\u201314% and up to 25% depending on expertise, is uncertain. Alternatives to clomiphene, such as letrozole (not yet approved for use as an ovulation induction agent by the Therapeutic Goods Administration in Australia, but available in New Zealand) and ovarian drilling, have greatly reduced risk of twins compared to clomiphene and FSH. Monozygotic twinning has not increased significantly over time and is perhaps only marginally increased by ART, estimated to occur in 1\u20132% of all ART pregnancies. Miller et al. provoke debate by the proposal to convert what has been a successful voluntary collective action to a mandatory process. This proposal has merit \u2013 women aged over 40 with a reduced chance of achieving a pregnancy from ART are particularly likely to express desire for DET. These women are more likely to have medical problems (e.g. hypertension and insulin resistance) and to have uterine problems (e.g. fibroids and adenomyosis) which increase the maternal risk of pregnancy and predispose to preterm birth. It is older women using their own oocytes who are at risk of twin pregnancy with discordant fetal aneuploidy/euploidy and its consequent complexities and ethical dilemmas. Commissioning couples of surrogate (gestational carriage) arrangements frequently express a wish for twin pregnancy to provide a complete family from one cryopreserved embryo transfer cycle (and the costs of surrogate arrangements are considerable) but in doing so increase the risk to the women undertaking an altruistic but not risk-free life event. Mandating SET in such settings (older women and surrogate arrangements) seems wise but will not be universally effective as 2.3% of pregnancies following SET are twin pregnancies with only one in five twin pregnancies being estimated as due to concomitant natural conception (and therefore preventable); the rest are presumed to be monozygotic twins. As women age the risk of an adverse event during their pregnancy becomes higher. Is a twin pregnancy at 40 safer than a singleton pregnancy at 40 and a subsequent singleton pregnancy at 43 or perhaps 45 years of age? While the costs of parenting twins are more than double the cost of raising two singletons there are economies from reduced time out of the workforce in order to parent. However, few couples undertaking ART and requesting DET are aware that twinning is associated with increased maternal morbidity. Once twins have survived the first few years of life (and ART twins are just as likely as spontaneously conceived twins to do so) their life expectancy is not reduced compared to singletons. Twins have lower risk of suicide. One in 30 adults in the USA has a twin sibling and as such, community experience of twins is positive and twins are seen as special. However, the loss of twins (and the sevenfold increase in mortality seen in low and medium resource settings) is to the wider community largely unseen and this results in cognitive dissonance between the medical profession and healthcare consumers. The potential for ART to contribute to twinning, which is seen in other countries, is significantly influenced by public funding of ART and increasing out-of-pocket costs. Reduction of funding of ART will increase pressure on providers of ART and their patients to perform DET and thereby increase multiple births and all of their attendant costs. Mandating SET might at first seem to solve this problem. However, mandates in clinical care create tension between expressed needs for patient autonomy and collective utilitarianism and resource allocation. Restrictions of access to services cause people to look elsewhere for what they cannot have, as the rise of crossborder reproductive care has shown. A key driver to cross-border care is law evasion and of this we must be mindful. The imperative becomes maintenance of funding for ART and perhaps, as proposed by Miller et al., financial incentives to encourage SET.", "year": 2016, "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdfdirect/10.1111/ajo.12526", "status": "CLOSED"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "34864051", "name": "C.

CHAPA (Cow-calf Health and Productivity Audit) studies indicate that dystocia is responsible for 33 percent of all calf losses and 15.4 percent of beef cattle breeding losses. Dystocia can have a large economic impact on producers due to calf death, veterinary costs, decreased rebreeding efficiency , and injury or death to the cow. In three different studies, dystocia was the highest veterinary cost to cow-calf operations in Colorado, California, and Tennessee. (Salma et al., April and May 1991) Dystocia is also the number one cause of calf mortality in the first 96 hours of life. (Patterson et al.) Pregnancy rates for the dam after losing a calf are lower than for dams that have not lost a calf. (Patterson et al.) Studies also indicate that animals experiencing dystocia while delivering a live calf may have decreased rebreeding rates. Therefore, a sound management program to reduce dystocia and rapidly identify cattle experiencing dystocia is critical to cattle welfare and farm profitability. General The average length of gestation for cattle is 280 days, with a normal range of 273 to 296 days. A twin pregnancy will average 3 to 6 days less. There are three stages of labor in normal calving: 1. First stage: The first stage of labor is when the cervix is dilating. This stage can last between 1 and 24 hours, but usually it is between 2 to 6 hours. Cows will often separate from the herd, and may be restless. They will not eat or drink and can have a vaginal discharge. 2. Second stage: The second stage begins when the cow starts contracting and continues until the calf is delivered. The amniotic sac, or water bag, will appear at the vulva. The fetus starts to enter the birth canal which then stimulates contractions that can be seen as abdominal press. A general rule is that delivery should be complete within 2 hours after the amniotic sac appears. 3. Third stage: The third stage is when the placenta (afterbirth) is delivered. The placenta usually passes within the first 8 hours after birth. It is considered \" retained \" at 12 to 24 hours, but manually removing the afterbirth is not recommended. Dystocia is when it becomes difficult or impossible for the cow to deliver the calf without assistance.

Actually, these experiments led to two of major concepts and fundamental principles of reproductive immunology using the bovine species as a model for biomedical research, namely the concept of acquired immunological tolerance and the paradox of the semiallogeneic bovine foetus whereby such organism can develop within an immunologically competent host. Peter Medawar, a scientist who together with Frank Macfarlande Burnet shared the 1960 Nobel Prize in physiology or medicine for discovery of acquired immunological tolerance, while studying dizygotic cattle twins, thereby giving birth to reproductive immunology. Also, these findings significantly influenced development of organ transplants and showed that using farm animals as models for studying transplantation immunology had general relevance for mammalian biology and health including those of humans. However, the interest for further research of the fascinating maternal immune influences on pregnancy and perinatal outcomes and of the prevention and treatment of immunologically mediated reproductive disorders in viviparous mammals of veterinary relevance by veterinary immunologists and reproductive clinicians have been very scarce regarding the application of nonspecific immunomodulatory agents for prevention and treatment of subfertility and infertility in pigs and cattle, but still broadening knowledge in this area and hold great potential for improving such therapy in the future.

The results of the study of relationships between mendelating candidate genes and markers with alleles of complex traits are contradictory. To increase the effectiveness of research, a comprehensive population-hybridological approach to the analysis of relationships of the first type markers with breeding traits is proposed. The effectiveness of this approach is demonstrated by studying the relationship between milk protein polymorphism and the signs of milk productivity in the population of Kholmogorsky cattle. According to \u03b2-Cn (CSN2), the association of the \u03b2-CnA2 allele with increased milk productivity of cows was established at the population level. The genetic determination of the identified association was confirmed by family (segregation) and twin analysis. No associations were found for \u03b2-Lg (LGB) at the level of the population as a whole and for subpopulations stratified by breeding status. The relationships of \u03b2-lactoglobulin polymorphism with milk yield in the samples representing individual breeding plants turned out to be multidirectional, but statistically significant in five cases out of five at a significance level of P<0.05. In the herds of the two leading breeding plants, the \"marker effects\" remained unchanged by sign for several generations. With perfect similarity in the frequencies of the \u03b2-Lg genes, opposite associations were observed in these breeding plant herds. In the offspring of heterozygous producers from the analyzing crosses between the mendelating genes and the quantitative trait polygenes, the associations characteristic of the populations from which the heterozygotes originated were preserved in the direction. The level of selection differentiation of marker alleles depended on the level of average milk productivity of the herd. The paper discusses the influence of environmental and genetic factors on the formation of associations. It is concluded that it is impossible to focus research on obtaining \"average\" effects of genes in \"average\" conditions, abstracted from specific genotypic and environmental situations of their manifestation. The solution to this problem is to improve the research ideology, which is currently limited to the registration of reliable associations of markers with polygenic quantitative traits in retrospective reference samples, followed by extrapolation of the results obtained to genetically different populations located in other environmental conditions. In animal breeding (for example, with plant selection), it is necessary to develop a theory of the ecological and genetic organization of a quantitative trait, since the structure and relative contribution of genes to the manifestation of a trait can change depending on variations in environmental conditions.", "year": 2021, "openAccessPdf": null, "authors": [{"authorId": "89139280", "name": "V.

Such a treatment would increase the likelihood that the cow receives at least one embryo competent for sustained development. In addition, transfer of two embryos into the ipsilateral uterine horn is likely to increase the amounts of interferon-tau and other embryonic-signaling molecules in the uterus. A total of 32 virgin crossbreed heifers and 26 lactating crossbreed cows were used as timed embryo transfer recipients after being subjected to an ovulation synchronization protocol as follows: GnRH (100 \u00bcg) and insertion of previously used progesterone-containing CIDR on Day -10, prostaglandin F2\u00b1 and CIDR removal on Day -3, and GnRH (100 \u00bcg) on Day 0 (day of anticipated ovulation). All recipients had a palpable CL on Day 6 and were randomly selected to receive one (n = 31 recipients) or two (n = 27) embryos on Day 7. At Day 64, the pregnancy rate tended to be higher (P = 0.07) for cows than for heifers. While not significant, heifers that received two embryos tended to have lower pregnancy rates than those that received a single embryo (20% vs. 41%); there was no difference in pregnancy rate in cows (50% for two embryos vs. 57% for one embryo). Pregnancy losses between Day 64 and Day 127 occurred in one group only cows receiving two embryos. In that group, pregnancy rate was 50% at Day 64 but 17% at Day 127. Overall, there was no difference in pregnancy rates at day 127 between cows and heifers, but recipients that received two embryos (17% for cows and 20% for heifers) had lower pregnancy rates (P < 0.03) than recipients that received one embryo (57% for cows and 41% for heifers). Only one animal, a cow, had twin fetuses at day 127. In conclusion, unilateral transfer of two embryos failed to improve pregnancy rates of dairy cattle exposed to heat stress. The fact that fetal loss occurred sooner for heifers than for cows points out the importance of uterine capacity as a limiting factor for maintenance of fetal development of two conceptuses. The suitability of timed embryo transfer was evident from the high pregnancy rates achieved with crossbreed females that received a single embryo.

Four studies were conducted to examine the association between alleles of the BoLA\u2010A locus and reproductive performance. Testis size, which is an indicator of early puberty and increased fertility in young bulls, was examined in 440 yearling bulls from nine breeds with a gene substitution model that included the effects of breed, sire, age of dam and age or weight of the bull. Estimated breeding value for twinning was examined with a gene substitution model with 204 cattle from a herd with a high frequency of twinning. Fertility of potential partners having BOLA\u2010A locus alleles in common was examined in a prospective study involving 101 pure\u2010bred Hereford cows mated by artificial insemination to four pure\u2010bred Hereford bulls.

The objectives of this study were to establish the prevalence of perinatal mortality (calf death within 24 h of calving) in Irish dairy herds and to determine the current significance of putative risk factors in pasture-based management systems. A total of 182 026 records of full-term calvings from Holstein-Friesian dams served by artificial insemination (AI) sires of seven breeds in herds of 20 calvings or more per year were available from the Irish national breeding database over 4 years (2002 to 2005). The prevalence of perinatal mortality was 4.29% (7.7% in primiparae and 3.5% in pluriparae). The likelihood of perinatal mortality increased between 2002 and 2005 and was greatest in June and in winter. There was an interaction (P < 0.001) between the effect of calving assistance and parity with the effect of dystocia on perinatal mortality being greater in primiparae. The odds of perinatal mortality were greater in male (OR = 1.12; P < 0.001) and in twin calves (OR = 5.70-13.36; P < 0.001) and in dams that had perinatal mortality at the previous calving (OR = 4.21; P < 0.001). The logit of the probability of perinatal mortality increased by 0.099 per unit increase in sire predicted transmitting ability (PTA) for direct perinatal mortality. The probability of perinatal mortality increased at an increasing rate in primiparae as animals calved at a younger age relative to the median age at first calving. The only herd-level factor examined, herd size did not affect the odds of perinatal mortality. These data indicate that the prevalence of perinatal mortality in this cattle population is similar to that in other pasture-based dairy systems worldwide. The putative exposures and attributes traditionally associated with perinatal mortality were associated with perinatal mortality in this pasture-based dairy cow population. The practical implication of these results is that as many of the significant risk factors are largely not under management control (year of calving, month of calving, twin calving, primiparity, previous perinatal mortality and foetal gender), herd owners must focus on the significant determinants under their control (age at first calving, sire genetic merit for direct perinatal mortality and both the extent of calving supervision and the degree of assistance), in order to reduce the prevalence of perinatal mortality and improve perinatal welfare.", "year": 2008, "openAccessPdf": null, "authors": [{"authorId": "2243550495", "name": "John F.

Ijsrm.Human, 2022; Vol. 21 (2): 1-8. 2 INTRODUCTION Pregnancy is a physiological phenomenon that occurs in mammalian species, characterized by the fertilization of the maternal egg by the paternal sperm, giving rise to a new individual. Pregnancies can be classified as single and twin or multiple. Twin gestation is a complex condition observed in most wild or domestic animal species and occurs when the female gives birth to two or more offspring, usually from the same mating. A twin pregnancy can happen when an embryo splits in two, giving rise to identical twins, or, a more common form, when multiple ovulation occurs due to hormonal imbalances, generating different individuals (FACIOLI et al., 2020). However, studies have shown that, for some species of domestic animals, especially those of production, both mono and poly ovulatory, the induction of twin or multiple gestations constitutes an important tool in the search for the best production rates and for the sustainability of the system (CAVALIERI et al.,2018). This induction can be based on the use of different reproductive biotechniques or may associate with other techniques, such as genetic improvement and changes in nutritional management. In the case of small ruminants, such as sheep and goats, it is known that most ewes and goats have only one offspring per pregnancy, as they are mostly mono ovulatory, however, multiple pregnancies can occur and their incidence varies between 20% and 40% in the sheep species and, in the case of the goat species, Medeiros et al.(2006) found 52.3% of twin births in AngloNubian goats. However, recognizing the economic benefits of twin pregnancies in these species, scholars have sought to increase the incidence of these pregnancies, through genetic manipulation, use of reproduction biotechniques, and/or nutritional adaptations of the matrices. The ovulation rate in sheep varies with race, age, and nutritional condition, being regulated by several genes, thus, in Brazil, scientists who evaluated the Santa In\u00eas sheep breed found the FecGE (FecG-Embrapa \u2013 Fecundity Gene) gene GDF9 and found that ewes with this FecGE variant have an 82% higher ovulation rate than others that do not have this change, thus, replicating animals with this variant increases the occurrence of twin or multiple pregnancies, resulting in an increase in the offspring of Santa In\u00eas sheep (CHAVES et al., 2021). www.ijsrm.humanjournals.com Citation: M\u00e1rcia Aparecida Andreazzi et al. Ijsrm.Human, 2022; Vol. 21 (2): 1-8. 3 Other studies induced twin pregnancy in ewes through the use of reproduction biotechniques. Seeking to evaluate the effects of different doses of equine chorionic gonadotropin (eCG) in the synchronization protocol of Santa In\u00eas sheep in the Argentine subtropics, Arbu\u00e9set al.(2018) showed mean values of 15% of double pregnancy in the treated animals. Gottardiet al. (2014) analyzed the use of a hormonal protocol for estrus synchronization and FTAI on the reproductive performance of Morada Nova and Santa In\u00eas ewes and obtained a higher percentage of multiple births of pregnant ewes by FTAI than by natural breeding, submitted to flushing. Thus, it is inferred that the induction of twin births in sheep can favor the efficiency, profitability, and sustainability of production systems. Even so, more studies are needed to highlight the different directions of investigations; therefore, the objective of this work was to carry out a qualitative and quantitative study on the topic of twin pregnancy in sheep, through a scientometric evaluation of the topic, in order to investigate the scientific behavior on this subject in the last 20 years. MATERIALS AND METHODS The object of analysis was the scientific production between the years 2000 to 2020, published in journals indexed on the Web of Science (HTTP: //www.webofscience.com) and Scientific Electronic Library Online (SciELO) (https://www.scielo.org), according to the methodological recommendations of Braun and Schubert (1988). The search for scientific articles was performed using the following descriptors: double or twin or multiple pregnancies and double or twin or multiple births in sheep, in English and Portuguese. The survey resulted in 62 scientific articles. Afterward, the 62 articles were evaluated to identify the following information: year of publication, thematic axis, and identification of the main journals, in addition to the classification of the journal according to the QUALIS/CAPES/BRAZIL criteria, in the area of Veterinary Medicine. Data were tabulated and organized in an electronic spreadsheet and descriptive analysis was used. www.ijsrm.humanjournals.com Citation: M\u00e1rcia Aparecida Andreazzi et al. Ijsrm.Human, 2022; Vol. 21 (2): 1-8. 4 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION The results on the historical evolution during the period from 2000 to 2020 showed a growing increase in the number of publications, especially in recent years (Figure 1). This fact highlights the topicality of the topic and the researchers' concern to assess the positive and negative points of twin pregnancy in sheep and its impacts on productivity rates. Figure No. 1: Percentage of scientific articles published on \u201cTwin pregnancy in sheep\u201d, according to the three-year period of publication (n: 62). Regarding the objectives of the research conducted with sheep (Table 1), it was found that the main topics discussed were the performance of lambs (RAMIREZ-TELLO et al.,2013; KORITIAKI et al.,2013; CU\u00c9LLAR et al., 2018; GARC\u00cdA-CH\u00c1VEZ et al., 2020) wool production performance (VAN WYK et al., 2008; SOUZA et al., 2011), on aspects related to pregnancy (ARAUJO et al., 2014), comparison between biochemical parameters between single and twin gestations (SANTAROSA et al., 2019), pregnancy toxemia, which is a metabolic disorder that can affect ewes with multiple gestations (SANTOS et al., 2011), reproductive management (RODR\u00cdGUEZ-S\u00c1NCHEZ et al., 2020) and reproductive performance of sheep (BANCHERO et al., 2015; CHAI-CANUL et al., 2019; SOUSA et al., 2019), which together accounted for 77.43% of the publications. In a smaller percentage, articles that addressed carcass yield (CRUZ-COL\u00cdN et al., 2006), genetic progress (TRILLO-Z\u00c1RATE et al., 2019), birth evaluation (FERNANDES et al., 2013), www.ijsrm.humanjournals.com Citation: M\u00e1rcia Aparecida Andreazzi et al.

In particular, it was the objective of this\n study to clarify whether or not a treatment at the time of diagnosis was\n under all circumstances necessary or if a waiting period between diagnosis\n and treatment, attempting to profit from the self cure of the animals and\n reduce the use of medication, brought the same results. Two hundred and eighty-three animals with chronic endometritis from\n seven dairy farms, which took part in the herd health program offered by the\n Production Medicine Unit of the Clinic for Cattle of the University\n of Veterinary Medicine Hannover,\n participated in this study. Diagnosis of endometritis started from the 14th\n day postpartum on by means of palpation through the rectum and vaginoscopy.\n The animals were re-examined in 14 or 28 days intervals depending on the\n farm\u2019s management program. At the time of diagnosis, the decision for a\n treatment was postponed in 212 cows (74,91 %, Group A), while 71 animals\n (25,09 %, Group B) were treated immediately. Between time of diagnosis and\n clinical cure, a treatment was initiated in 35 animals (Subgroup A2) of Group\n A (16,5 % of this group), while a change in medication was made in 14 animals\n (Subgroup B2) of Group B (19,7 % of this group). Consequently, 177 animals of\n Group A (Subgroup A1) remained without treatment and 57 animals of Group B\n (Subgroup B1) were treated with only one medication. The improvement of the\n clinical symptoms was similar between animals that did and did not receive a\n treatment. The animals were treated using routine medication, either locally\n (disinfectants or antibiotics) or systemically (analogs of PGF2\u03b1).\n 1) The most important single factor that\n affected the classification of severity of a chronic endometritis was the\n time of diagnosis. The animals by which the diagnosis took place \u226421st\n day postpartum showed a highly statistically significant greater percent of\n severe endometritis compared with the animals by which the diagnosis followed\n beyond this time.\n 2) The clinical cure rate was very high (98,59\n %) and only one animal was culled because of an endometritis that was\n resistant to therapy. Only 14 % of the animals did not show a complete\n clinical cure based on vaginal results by the end of the puerperium (42nd\n day). Already at the first re-examination (39 \u00b1 11 d postpartum) the uterus\n could be gathered under the hand in 98,23 % of the cases and moreover, there\n was no ill smelling vaginal discharge in 92,93 % of the animals. The presence\n of abnormal vaginal discharge persisted for a longer period, but it was\n characterised as mucopurulent or clear with the presence of purulent flakes\n in 78 % of these cases (81 from 103). 3) Under the conditions of this retrospective\n field study, a grouping of the animals into those with a fast (Subgroups A1\n and B1) and those with a slow (Subgroups A2 and B2) clinical cure became\n apparent. This tendency for a slow clinical cure was the reason to start or\n repeat a treatment. On the other hand, the change of our primary decision to\n treat (Group B) or not to treat (Group A) an animal had little influence on\n the outcome of the clinical cure, so that the Subgroups A1 and B1 reached a\n clinical cure significantly earlier compared to the Subgroups A2 and B2.\n 4) The presence of a Corpus luteum or the\n severity of endometritis did not play an important role within a group. On\n the contrary, the animals of all groups with a diagnosis >21st\n day postpartum reached the clinical cure at a later time than cows with a\n diagnosis \u226421st day. Considering the group of untreated\n animals (A1), it seemed that the infection of the uterus was more a dynamic\n process that took place throughout the whole puerperium than a static event\n that occured only during the first days postpartum.\n 5) The two subgroups, which reached the\n clinical cure later (A2 and B2) and which were consequently treated later for\n the first time, or with a change of the treatment,\n revealed better results concerning some of the\n fertility measures. As a consequence, a slower clinical cure might not necessarily\n be related to a suppressed fertility.\n 6) In general, there was no clear superiority\n of a treatment strategy with respect to the fertility measures. With regard\n to other factors, a positive effect of treatment was found for the first\n service conception rate, the pregnancy index and the conception rate. 7) In cases of severe endometritis, a\n treatment could be recommended. Additionally, a weak positive influence of a\n treatment could be established in the absence of a Corpus luteum at the time\n of diagnosis or, when the diagnosis was made after the 21st day\n postpartum. The postponement of the decision (Subgroup A2) to treat or not to\n treat did not have a negative influence on fertility measures. The animals of\n Group A2 revealed an improvement of the first service conception rate, the\n pregnancy index and the conception rate. This fact represents a higher\n effectiveness of a treatment with increasing interval from calving.\n 8) Although the animals with risk factors (torsio\n uteri, dystocia, early birth or stillbirth, birth of twins or an abort) and\n with retained fetal membranes had a higher rate of severe endometritis\n compared with cases without complications, this difference was only present\n as a trend in the first case. Risk factors did not seem to have a negative\n influence on the clinical cure, while the retention of the fetal membranes\n caused a slower clinical cure as a tendency. Intensive care of the animals in\n the first days of the puerperium can consequently counterbalance the negative\n influence of these factors. Risk factors and retained fetal membranes did not\n suppress the fertility measures of the animals any further.\n 9) Management factors, such as a high\n reduction of the body condition and a milk production higher than 10000 kg,\n as well as the appearance of ovarian cysts after the 42nd day\n postpartum suppressed statistically significantly almost all of the fertility\n measures of animals diagnosed with chronic endometritis. The large\n differences in the fertility measures between farms, stress the importance of\n a comprehensive management program in the puerperium as well as in the period\n thereafter.", "year": 2005, "openAccessPdf": null, "authors": [{"authorId": "2084752587", "name": "Georgios Tsousis"}]}

Eight beef cattle breeds, Angus (A), Blonde d' Aquitaine (BA), Charolais (C), Czech Pied (CP), Hereford (H), Limousin (L), Piemontese (P) and Simmental (S), were analysed for the following calf traits: birth weight (BW), 210- and 365-day weight ( 210W, 365W) and average daily gains from birth to 210 days (ADG1), from 210 to 365 days (ADG2) and from birth to 365 days (ADG3). Phenotypic parameters were estimated by linear model procedures including the fixed effects of year of birth (1992\u20131998), herd, sex (male, female), calf number (single, twin), parity and random sire effects. Literature values of heritability estimates were used to derive genetic standard deviations and genetic range for comparison of genetic variation within and between breeds. The means of Blonde d' Aquitaine were highest for all growth traits except for BW, followed by Charolais and Simmental, then Angus, Czech Pied and Limousin with intermediate values and Piemontese and Hereford with lowest growth except for BW in Piemontese and ADG1 in Hereford. Blonde d' Aquitaine also showed high standard deviations for most growth traits except for BW, whereas for Limousin and Piemontese low standard deviations were estimated and for other breeds no consistent pattern was observed. Coefficients of variation were generally high for Hereford and low for Angus. Hypothetical frequency curves were used for comparison of genetic variation within breeds and between breeds. Comparison of extreme and average breeds showed ranges of genetic levels between 79 and 154 % of the average breed level thus indicating the large overall genetic variation for growth traits in beef cattle. Between-breed selection with immediate impact, but steady erosion by time, as well as within-breed selection with slow but steady increase and renewed variation should both be applied for optimal exploitation of genetic resources in the beef industry.", "year": 2003, "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://aab.copernicus.org/articles/46/143/2003/aab-46-143-2003.pdf", "status": "GOLD"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2263294123", "name": "Vaclav Jakubec"}, {"authorId": "87950261", "name": "W.

Although they are commonly monovular, they can sustain twin or other multiple pregnancies to term. In cows with a single pregnancy, the embryo implants in the uterine horn that is on the side of ovulation where a corpus luteum develops. Multiple pregnancies are classified into bilateral (one or more embryos in each uterine horn) and unilateral (all embryos in the same uterine horn, right or left) and, in both cases, embryos occur on the side of their corresponding corpus luteum or corpora lutea. Multiple pregnancies are undesirable in dairy herds as they compromise the reproductive performance and productive lifespan of cows. The present study sought to: (a) gain information on the incidence of twin pregnancies, (b) assess and expand information on the relative incidence of bilateral twins compared to unilateral twins, (c) confirm corresponding laterality between embryos and corpora lutea, (d) tabulate the frequency of triplets or quadruplets, and (e) evaluate possible effects of environmental heat stress conditions on the incidence of multiple pregnancies. The data for this study were derived from the ultrasonographic examination of 1130 cows carrying twins, triplets, or quadruplets, and 3160 cows carrying singletons. Abstract Multiple pregnancies have devastating consequences on the herd economy of dairy cattle. This observational study examines incidence patterns based on data from the ultrasonographic examination of 1130 multiple pregnancies in cows in their third lactation or more carrying twins (98.8%), triplets (1.1%), or quadruplets (0.08%), and 3160 of their peers carrying singletons. Cows became pregnant following a spontaneous estrus with no previous hormone treatments. Irrespective of a significant decrease (p < 0.0001) in the conception rate (28\u201334 days post-insemination) during the warm period of the year, the multiple pregnancy rate was similar for both warm (26.5%) and cool (26.3%) periods. The incidence of unilateral multiple pregnancies (all embryos in the same uterine horn) was higher than that of bilateral pregnancies (at least one embryo in each uterine horn): 54.4% versus 45.6% (p < 0.0001). This difference rose to 17% during the warm season (p = 0.03). Pregnancy was monitored in unilateral multiple pregnancies until abortion or parturition (n = 615). In the warm period, the parturition rate was 43% compared to 61% recorded in the cool period (p < 0.0001). Thus, a warm climate is the main factor compromising the fate of multiple pregnancies.

In contrast, the ratio of fetal numbers to ovulation sites in pregnant females with twin (0.83) or triplet (0.73) ovulations is <1.0 and the number of calves per parturition is 1.6 and 2.0, respectively. Failure of individual twin or triplet ovulations to yield a conceptus in fertile females indicates a significant contribution of ovulation or oocyte anomalies to increased fertilization failure or early embryonic mortality. The present objective was to identify physiological traits affecting conception in cyclic cattle expressing multiple ovulations naturally, including the effect of ovulation rate on follicle or corpus luteum (CL) size, and their relationship to conception. Diameter of the individual ovulatory follicles was measured by transrectal ultrasonography at AI and ranged from 8 to 30 mm, with a trend for diameter of the individual follicles, and associated CL, to decrease with increasing ovulation rate. Independent of ovulation rate, ovulatory follicles were smaller (P < 0.05) for nulliparous heifers (1.5 yr) compared with parous cows (> or =2.5 yr). Pregnancy and fetal status were diagnosed by transrectal ultrasonography between 42 and 72 d after AI. Fertility was reduced (P < 0.01) for small twin or triplet ovulatory follicles (8 to 8.9 mm vs. 10 to 17.9 mm diam.), whereas fertility in monovular females was reduced (P < 0.01) for large ovulatory follicles (> or =22 vs. 14 to 17.9 mm). Plasma progesterone concentrations increased with ovulation rate and were correlated positively with total CL or ovulatory follicle volume per female, indicating that CL size and function were influenced by the size of the follicle of origin. Progesterone was greater (P < 0.05) in the blood of nulliparous heifers compared with parous cows. The increased proportion of small ovulatory follicles associated with twin and triplet ovulations indicates that some ovulatory follicles were either selected to ovulate at a lesser stage of maturity or rescued while undergoing atresia, thus compromising oocyte competency or ovulation. Of greatest importance for reduced fertility was the greater incidence of pregnancy losses occurring in the middle of gestation in females gestating 2 or more fetuses as an apparent effect of uterine crowding, especially when 2 or more fetuses were contained within 1 uterine horn.", "year": 2009, "openAccessPdf": null, "authors": [{"authorId": "5758319", "name": "S.

The percentage of calves determined not to be freemartins was substantially higher than the 8% reported for an unselected population of female co-twins. We concluded that some obvious freemartins were eliminated prior to submission of samples for confirmatory cytogenetic diagnosis, and that only a small percentage of the estimated 93,000 female calves born co-twin to male calves annually are so examined. Therefore, probably a large number of female co-twins that are not truly freemartins are sold to slaughter every year.

Increased knowledge about the principal causes of reduced fertility is essential. Increases in milk yield have been at the expense of reduced fertility in dairy cows and although diet has a major impact, the precise interaction between nutrition and reproduction still needs to be characterized in both beef and dairy cows. Furthermore, during periods of inadequate nutrition or stress, the intensity of oestrus is reduced by inadequate exposure to oestradiol. However, it is still unclear which pheromones are involved at oestrus, how synthesis is controlled and how pheromones are detected in herd-mates. GnRH may be involved in behaviour but the brain centres that translate hormonal messages are unknown. Attempts to overcome poor oestrous detection include measurements of milk progesterone, telemetric pressure detectors and devices that record the extra activity at oestrus. Substitution of heat detection by 'hormone treatment remedies' has met strong consumer resistance in Europe. The creation of larger cattle units and increased movements world-wide render herds more susceptible to infectious agents, such as Neospora, Leptospira, Trypanosoma and Bovine Viral Diarrhoea virus (BVDv), but it is unclear how other clinical conditions, such as lameness or endometritis, also interfere with ovarian function.

Agriculture and animal husbandry are the twin occupations upon which most of the rural people of Assam are dependent for their livelihood. Though, Assam as well as India has a substantial livestock population yet the production of milk and other livestock product is about the lowest in the world. In absence of sufficient grazing ground for maintaining cattle, sheep, goat on pasture, the importance of cultivation of forage crops to provide feed economically for production of milk, for draught animals need special emphasis. Improved package of practices based forage cultivation is still in its infancy stage in Assam and people generally depend on locally available forage. However, the grazing grounds are shrinking mainly due to population explosion which resulted in low availability of green forage making grazing animals malnourished both for maintenance and production. Nutrition is an integral part of livestock development. In dairy industry green grasses constitute the major ingredient of animal diet. Moreover, green grasses provide most of the essential vitamins and minerals required by the herbivorous animals. The effort made by the Animal Husbandry & Veterinary Department since 1960s to promote cultivation of high yielding fodder grasses in Assam met with negligible progress, although it is of paramount importance for the all-round development of livestock industry in the region. Scarcity of green grasses can greatly be reduced and cost of maintaining such animals in a commercial farm can be greatly reduced when cultivation of high yielding grasses viz. napier, hybrid napier, guinea, para grass, cowpea, maize, oats, teosinte, sorghum, subabul etc. are practiced within the farm premises. However, for selection of the type of grass to be cultivated in a particular farm yard for optimum performance, one should have a clear knowledge about the soil type. Animals are dependent on plants and plants on soil. Soil supplies all the essential micro and macro minerals required by the plant. Soil also supplies trapped atmospheric nitrogen to the plants. Thus soil makes the main natural media for cultivation of various plants including the fodder grasses. However, different fodder grasses needs different kinds of soil for their optimum growth.

While Ehrlich appreciated the potential catastrophic results of unchecked anti-self reactivity, there was no theoretical basis for selfnonself discrimination until Burnet proposed that the deletion of self-reactive clones occurred during fetal development of the immune system. Supporting this theory were the classical observations of Owen (1945) on dizygotic (and tolerant) fraternal cattle twins, and Billingham et al.'s (1956) induction of allogeneic transplantation tolerance in fetal mice. Studies since that time have established that tolerance can be established in mature adults as well as in immature perinatal animals (Weigle 1971), albeit by different mechanisms. Many of these tolerant systems have emphasized that the structural form of an administered antigen strongly influences its immunogenicity. Thus, it was found chat non-immunogenic forms of an antigen (for instance, deaggregated heterologous gamma globulins) are usually highly tolerogenic (Dresser 1962, Weigle 1973, Howard & Mitchison 1975).

Twin pregnancies compromise the health and wellbeing of cattle. The use of genomic testing for production traits and fitness traits to select replacement heifers is increasing in commercial dairy farms. Recently, a genomic prediction for twin pregnancies has been developed. The abortion of twin calves or parturition in the delivery of twins have been associated with the twin pregnancy trait (TWIN). However, the incidence of twins at abortion or at parturition are not a true reflection of twin pregnancy. A large number of pregnancy losses and twin reduction during the early fetal period are beyond clinical control. The rate of twin reduction is much higher than the rates of abortion and twin deliveries. The aim of this study was to evaluate factors affecting the incidence of twin pregnancies in high-producing primiparous dairy cows, with special emphasis placed on the genomic prediction values for twin pregnancy. Our study population of primiparous cows proved valuable in identifying factors other than genomic predictive values influencing the twin pregnancy rate. The photoperiod, milk production, and estrus synchronization protocol for fixed-time artificial insemination were found to significantly influence the rates of twin pregnancy. Abstract Twin pregnancies are highly undesirable in dairy cattle; they compromise the health and wellbeing of a cow and dramatically impair the farm economy. Recently, a genomic prediction for twin pregnancies has been developed. The objective of this study was to assess environmental and management risk factors affecting the incidence of twin pregnancies in high-producing dairy cows in their first lactation, with a special emphasis placed on the genomic prediction values of twin pregnancy. Our study population of primiparous cows proved valuable in identifying factors other than genomic predictive values that influence twin pregnancy rates. The odds ratio for twin pregnancies was 0.85 (p < 0.0001) for each unit of a prediction value increase, 3.5 (p = 0.023) for cows becoming pregnant during the negative photoperiod, and 0.33 (p = 0.016) for cows producing \u226542 kg of milk at AI, compared with the remaining cows who produced <42 kg of milk. As a general conclusion, the practical implication of our findings is that genomic prediction values can identify the risk of twin pregnancy at a herd level. Given the cumulative effect of genomic selection, selecting animals with a reduced genetic risk of twin pregnancies can contribute to reducing the incidence of twin pregnancies in dairy herds.", "year": 2023, "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://www.mdpi.com/2076-2615/13/12/2008/pdf?version=1686909471", "status": "GOLD"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "1398071649", "name": "F.

Goats can cope with a variety of dietary alternatives and they can flourish on forages and feeds, including kitchen refuse, that would otherwise be wasted. Goats are valuable for milk, meat, fiber, and leather and millions of people depend upon them for their livelihood. They are often called the poor man's cow because two does bred at alternate intervals can provide a family with a yearlong supply of milk and their small size and relatively low cost makes them available to small farmers who have neither space nor capital for a cow. Their productivities can be astounding. For example, a lifetime record holding doe in Britain produced 16,968 kg (37,330 lb) of milk in 2,966 lactating days, an average of 5.7 kg (12.5 lb) per day. As a general rule, fertility is no problem and twinning or more than one gestation per year is quite common. In spite of these attributes, the goat is the subject of a world-wide controversy and there are two opposing views about their role in land use. These are best expressed by quotations from two early references regarding the subject. Sir Daniel Hall in delivering the Heath Clark lectures for 1935 at the University of London, said: \"The greatest danger, however, lies in the fact that overgrazing may so destroy the vegetation and bare the surface that soil erosion sets in... of all livestock the goats are the worst offenders.... The brunt of the campaign against overstocking should fall on the goats. . .\" (Hall 1936). This view has been echoed by many sources since that time and in many cases goats have been categorically blamed as the cause of deforestation, rangeland destruction, erosion and desertification. Laws have been passed in some countries prohibiting the grazing of goats in certain areas and goat eradication campaigns have even been launched. At about the same time that Hall was delivering his lectures, Horn by (1936) wrote: \"The goat is often referred to as though its depredations exceeded those of other animals. This is not quite fair. The cattle and sheep have created a wilderness of gullies separated by dry ridges bearing nothing in the way of vegetation but the hardiest of shrubs,", "year": 1981, "openAccessPdf": null, "authors": [{"authorId": "145787350", "name": "J.

The sheep placenta expresses lactogenic (ovine placental lactogen, oPL) and somatogenic (ovine placental growth hormone, oGH) hormones. Our research has focused on the biological roles of oPL and oGH in function of the uterine endometrium during gestation and the mammary gland during pregnancy and lactation. Major conclusions were that: ( 1 ) immunization of prepubertal ewes against oPL resulted in increased birth weights of their lambs and their milk production during lactation; (2) neither oPL nor oGH had an antiluteolytic effect on uterine endometrium to affect lifespan of the corpus luteum; (3) only sequential exposure of the progesterone stimulated uterus to oIFNt and oPL or oGH increased endometrial gland proliferation and secretory protein gene expression; (4) oPL signals through a homodimer of ovine prolactin receptor (PRL-R) and heterodimer of oPRL-R and growth hormone receptor (GH-R); (5) exogenous recombinant oPL and oGH stimulated mammogenesis and milk yield during lactation; and (6) mutation of oPL and oGH was used to define specific biological effects and a rational basis for design of a specific receptor agonists or antagonists. This project was very productive in elucidating basic biological effects of oPL and oGH on intracellular signal transduction pathways, uterine development and secretory function, as well as mammogenesis and lactogenesis. We determined that immunization of prepubertal ewes against roPL increased birth weights of their lambs, especially those born as twins and triplets, as well as enhanced lactational performance. These studies significantly extended our knowledge of uterine and fetal-placental physiology and provided a foundation for new strategies to enhance reproductive and lactation efficiency. Based on these results, the major achievements were: 1) creation of a practical and cost effective management tool for producers to increase reproductive performance, neonatal survival, and milk yield of ewes in commercial flocks; and 2) define, for the first time, biological effects of oPL on endometrial functions and gene expression by uterine gland epithelium.", "year": 2001, "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://naldc.nal.usda.gov/download/7574339/PDF", "status": "BRONZE"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "5391090", "name": "F.

Medicine's a vocation, really. Calling it a job doesn't address the sacrifices we make. How often do we miss meals, miss sleep, or miss our families for patients? Sometimes our dedication to medicine causes us to lose our families entirely. Why, then, do we do it? We do it because medicine gives us something in return. Occasionally, that something is extraordinary. That something happened to me. In the fall of my third year of medical school, I had the opportunity to do a rural medicine clerkship in Valentine, Nebraska, a small ranching community in the northwest corner of the state. Students who had previously worked with the doctors in Valentine each had a story to telleverything from manic tourists to farmers kicked by a surly bovine. What would my story be? After one week in Valentine, I had no stories to tell. The days were relatively mundane conglomerations of managing hypertension and performing well-child checks. Doldrums in medicine are often short lived. A lunchroom conversation with a medical technician ended mine. You know, Lori, you really remind me of a nurse who used to work here. So, you have a lot of gorgeous, brilliant blondes here in Valentine, huh? I jokingly replied. I didn't give the conversation a second thought. However, the following week her comment was echoed by the physicians, phlebotomists, and pharmacists. Half the staff was engaged in casual banter about my carbon copy. Whoever this nurse was, I walked like her, talked like her, laughed like her, and wrinkled my nose like her. I had a twin, or so it seemed. As luck would have it, my twin was scheduled to come into the clinic the following week. Finally, a chance to see the remarkable resemblance everyone was talking about. Unfortunately, I never got the chance to meet her. During her appointment, I was dealing with another patient's gouty toe and saw just the back of her head as she walked out the clinic door. Like all jokes, this one had an expiration date. No more quips about my doppelgnger were made in the days that followed. Five days later, I scrubbed in on a melanoma excision. While the surgeon closed, the scrub nurse, anesthetist, and I made conversation. The scrub nurse said to me, Have you lived in Rapid City your whole life? I replied, Almost; I was in a foster home for 3 months before I was adopted. Forceps clattered to the floor. Silence. The anesthetist's eyes were bigger than God's ego. I imagined the scrub nurse's mouth dropping open behind her surgical mask. She spoke again: You aren't going to believe this I can't believe this! Believe what? I asked. She hesitated. This woman this woman you look exactly like gave up a baby for adoption. She was rightI wasn't going to believe it. I was offended that she would take a joke to that extent. I then realized she wasn't laughing. When the levee of shock gave way, my tears threatened to break the sterile field. I maintained some semblance of control until the last knot was tied. After the procedure, the scrub nurse approached me in the locker room. She had gone to high school with this woman and had pictures of her. Did I want to see them? The following evening, I went to the scrub nurse's house and drank a soda that I did not taste, while she rifled through her dusty annuals. She flipped past fading penned sentiments of Friends 4 Ever and stopped on a photo of a teenage girl. I could not breathe. I could not blink. It was my face. I was suddenly looking at my own high school yearbook. My mind was paralyzed by sheer disbelief, but in my heart, I knewthis woman had to be my birth mother. What now? A collision of nature and nurture? Do I even want this? What if she's a bad person? Do our hands look the same? Would she be proud of me? Has she ever regretted her decision to give me up? The resolution of my fears and answers to the questions about where I came from and who I am was only a few miles away on a Nebraska cattle ranch. The Fates had taken my hand to this point.

A tribute to a true pioneer.", "abstract": "Ray Owen died on September 21, 2014, just short of his 99th birthday. He will be chiefly remembered as the grandfather of the phenomenon of \u2018\u2018immunological tolerance,\u2019\u2019 and his ground-breaking contribution as long ago as 1945 will remain a cornerstone not only of transplantation immunology but also of immunology in general. Ray was born on a dairy farm in Genesee, Wisconsin, where, after school, he often helped with the milking of the cows. His early career was intimately linked with Wisconsin, for he obtained a B.Sc. in genetics at Carroll College and went on to Ph.D. studies in Malcolm Irwin\u2019s Department of Immunogenetics at the University of Wisconsin (Fig. 1). There he was introduced to the study of genetic markers, principally in farm animals, and together with Clyde Stormont, he embarked on a study of the inheritance of red blood cell antigens in cattle. This led to his astonishing and groundbreaking discovery that fraternal twin calves almost invariably possess red blood cells with two quite different phenotypesVtheir own and those of their twin partner. Owen published his findings in 1945 in a short article in the journal Science (1), in which he pointed out that several decades previously F.R. Lillie had shown that cattle twins normally develop an anastomosis of their fetal circulations, thus facilitating the free circulation of blood from one to the other. To explain his remarkable findings Owen postulated that the foreign red cell precursors had established themselves in their foreign hosts and, far from being rejected, continued to produce red blood cells in adult life. Owen wrote, \u2018\u2018Several interesting problems in the fields of genetics, immunology, and development are suggested by these observations,\u2019\u2019 not least among them the possible identification of the sterile female \u2018\u2018freemartin\u2019\u2019 when twinned with a male (Fig. 1). Owen\u2019s article was duly ignored until F.M. Burnet and F. Fenner published their monograph The Production of Antibodies\u2019\u2019 4 years later (2). As part of a wide-ranging theory of antibody production, they highlighted Owen\u2019s findings and put forward their notion of \u2018\u2018self-markers,\u2019\u2019 postulating that the presence of foreign cells in fetal life would prevent the formation of antibodies later in life. In extending their speculations to the nonfatal infection of embryos with pathogenic microorganisms, they postulated that \u2018\u2018tolerance to the foreign microorganisms\u2019\u2019 could come about. Thus, Owen\u2019s experimental observations and Burnet and Fenner\u2019s speculations marked the beginning of the tolerance story, which continues to the present day in the numerous attempts to induce tolerance in transplant recipients. It was through Burnet and Fenner\u2019s monograph that P.B. Medawar and his colleagues became aware of Owen\u2019s findings, which helped them to explain their quite independent and apparently paradoxical finding that cattle dizygotic twins almost invariably accepted each other\u2019s skin grafts after birth (3). They subsequently went on to explore the phenomenon of \u2018\u2018acquired immunological tolerance\u2019\u2019 in experimental animals, principally in mice and chickens (4, 5), which established tolerance as a universal phenomenon, enabling foreign tissues, such as skin grafts, to be permanently accepted in adult life.

At the time of this review, epidemiologic data supported that the incidence of twinning in Holstein dairy cows in the U.S. had increased over time (Kinsel et al., 1998). From an economic perspective in the U.S., lost revenue due to twinning was estimated to be $55 million per year (Johanson et al., 2001).

Recent technological advances in embryo splitting have increased the ability to produce sufficient identical twins for experimentation so it is now possible to exploit the uniformity that exists between genetically identical twins. Hancock (1951) published a series of papers on the similarity of identical twins in cattle, however, no results could be found for sheep. This paper reports the efficiency of the use of identical twins in wool sheep experiments. Thirty-five pairs of identical twins were produced over 2 years by splitting embryos collected at day 6 of pregnancy and placing each clone in a different recipient ewe. DNA testing has confirmed that the 35 pairs were identical. A wide range of fleece and body weight traits were measured at hogget age. The data were adjusted for the known environmental factors, ie birth year, sex of the lambs and age of the recipient dam and the intraclass correlation between members of a pair estimated. Efficiency was calculated according to the method of Biggers (1986) as defined in Table 1. The results presented in Table 1 indicate that 1 pair of identical twins can replace between 10 and 50 randomly selected animals in experiments without loss of statistical efficiency. Many investigations, however, involve the comparison of more than 2 treatments. Using a randomised block design, twins will allow the comparison of only 2 treatments. Biggers (1986) shows how these figures can be used to determine the most desirable experimental design where more than 2 treatments are involved.", "year": 1996, "openAccessPdf": null, "authors": [{"authorId": "145078054", "name": "J.

Immunological Tolerance and Autoimmunity 1. Tolerance", "abstract": "Normally we do not make immune responses against our own tissue, a concept known as \"self-tolerance\". Determining how the immune system distinguishes between self and foreign antigens to make the decision between tolerance and immunity has been a subject of detailed investigation during the past 50 years. In 1945, R.D.Owen made a crucial observation that suggested that tolerance to self-antigens occurred because the immune system was exposed to these antigens during early development. He came to this conclusion after observing that adult dizygotic twin cows each contained a mixture of their own and their twin's blood cells, indicating that they were equally tolerant of their own and each other's blood cell antigens. Exchange of blood between the two foetal cows occurred in utero because binovular cattle share a placenta. This crucial observation demonstrated that tolerance could be induced by exposure to antigens in utero, irrespective of whether they were self or foreign. Shortly after this, F.M.Burnet enunciated the Clonal Selection Theory, where he proposed that each lymphocyte was specific for only one antigen and if a lymphocyte met this antigen during early development it would be deleted from the repertoire. The theory was modified by J.Lederberg, who suggested correctly that it was the stage in the development or ontogeny of the lymphocyte that was critical, rather than the stage in development of the animal. There is now a large amount of evidence to support the Clonal Selection Theory for both T and B cells. Nevertheless, deletion of lymphocytes specific for self-antigens is not the only mechanism of self-tolerance. Both T and B cells specific for self-antigens can be identified in healthy people, so there must be mechanisms that prevent such cells from becoming activated and damaging self-tissue, thereby causing autoimmune disease. Although tolerance may be induced in all lymphocyte populations, CD4 + T cell self tolerance is the most important and occurs at a far lower antigen threshold than that for B and CD8 + cells. 2. Mechanisms of tolerance to self-antigens (i) Central tolerance by clonal deletion: Central tolerance refers to mechanisms of tolerance acting during lymphocyte development in the thymus or bone marrow. Experimental studies show that central tolerance is mostly due to the elimination or inactivation of those T and B cells that recognise self-antigens. These cells are destroyed or inactivated after they have expressed receptors for self-antigens and before they develop into fully immunocompetent lymphocytes.

However, the distribution of rain varies enormously, not only in space, but also in time. For example, in the Sahara huge lakes have come and gone as global climate changed in the last 10,000 years (Gasse, 2000), southern Africa has experienced extended periods of both warm wet and cold dry weather over the last 1000 years (Holmgren et al., 2003) and eastern Africa has suffered severe droughts within the last few hundred years (Gillson, 2006). This variation would be expected to have a major influence on human societies (Weiss & Bradley, 2001). Indeed, drying of the Sahara from about 5300 years ago can be related to development of pharaonic civilisation on the Nile and spread of pastoralism (Kuper & Krpelin, 2006). In southern Africa, sudden collapse of the city of Mapungubwe in 1290 AD and subsequent rise of Great Zimbabwe can be linked to first drought and then wetter conditions (Holmgren & Oberg, 2006). Whilst, in eastern Africa the disastrous Emutai period for the Maasai from 1883 to 1902, when cattle disease, small pox and famine devastated the population, was associated with drought (Gillson, 2006). However, we still have much to learn about African climate fluctuations and their socio-economic effects. Firstly, just when we thought we could relate climate change in Africa to fluctuations in sea surface temperatures in the Pacific Ocean, the so-called El Nino Southern Oscillation (Cane, Eshel & Buckland, 1994), a remarkable discovery has revealed a previously unknown climate driver, the Indian Ocean Dipole (Marchant et al., in press) which helps to explain observed divergence between ENSO activity and east African climate (Latif et al., 1999). Secondly, the relationship between society and climate is complex and unpredictable. For example the Mahlatule droughts in southern Africa in the early 19 century coincided with war, famine and dislocation amongst the Nguni peoples (p. 257 Newitt, 1995). This political instability was probably due not only to drought, but also increasing population and reliance on water-demanding maize (Holmgren & Oberg, 2006). The contrasting simultaneous rise of the Zulu Kingdom has been associated with changing environmental conditions leading to reorganisation and consolidation of control (Guy, 1980). Even more complicated, and in keeping with the principle of unintended consequences, drought-induced northward migration of the Nguni at this time into the Southern Highlands of Tanzania led to military development of the Hehe people as they coped with the incoming warlike Nguni (p. 56 Iliffe, 1979). This meant that when German colonisers arrived in Iringa at the end of the 19 century they encountered an efficient Hehe fighting force, which inflicted a famous defeat at Lugalo (p. 109 Iliffe, 1979) and which was subsequently avenged by strict German military rule. The upshot of this was massive socio-economic disruption resulting in vast tracts of unpopulated forested land which were later gazetted as forest reserves in the 1950s and as the Udzungwa National Park in 1992 (Lovett, 2003). Another interesting Tanzanian tale of the interplay between climate and politics is the strange case of the Ground Nut Scheme in the 1940s. The then British administered Tanganyika government implemented a massive public-works scheme devoted to cultivating ground nuts in a huge area of arid bush at Kongwa. The scheme was forced to end because of a drought in 1949, but not before \u00a335,870,000 had been spent, equivalent to the total expenditure of the Tanganyika Government in the four years between 1946 and 1950 (p. 441, Iliffe, 1979). Speaking later, the Governor at the time, Sir Edward Twining, put a positive spin on the debacle: \u2018\u2018Among the assets that the Ground Nut Scheme has left us was a great deal of knowledge of how to farm in dry areas and research work which has been of considerable value.\u2019\u2019 (p. 18, Twining, 1959) Correspondence: Jon C.

Thus, immunogenetic methods allowed significant reduction of errors in the control of pedi-gree of breeders. Studies of the interrelationships of blood groups with economically useful signs of animals are in progress. Infertility and barrenness in cattle lead to huge economic losses. The purpose of this work was to identify the relationship between antigenic similarity of blood groups in parents and reproduction indicators in cattle. The study was carried out from 2009 to 2014 in Sverd-lovsk Region in the livestock farms Mezenskoe LLC (Beloyarsky Region), Pervouralsky Integrated Agricultural Production Center (Pervouralsk Town District) and Artemovsky Farming Company LLC (Artemovsky Region) using 1300 pairs of Ural-type black-and-white cattle. The mated animals were authentic in origin and certified for blood groups. For their certification, 54 monospecific sera to 11 blood group systems were used. In mated animals the index of antigenic similarity of blood groups, expressed as the ratio of similar antigens in bulls and cows to their total number, and homozygosity on EAA, EAF, and EAZ blood group systems were calculated. These blood group systems were represented by several antigens which makes it possible to trace immune conflict in mated animals. By biometrical processing, it was identified that the pairs which were heterozygous in EAA and EAF antigens showed higher efficiency of conception and better survival of the offspring, though the twinning frequency decreased. The parents homozygous in EAA system produced the progeny in which the amount of aborted embryos was 2.5 % higher than that in the heterozygous pairs. The number of calves born dead from the EAF-homozygous pairs was twice as much as that of heterozy- gous pairs. Apparently, the immune conflict, which leads to the extended period from delivery to productive insemination and higher offspring death, decreases in animals homozygous in EAZ sys- tem. The number of calves born dead was 3.2 % for homozygous pairs and 4.7 % for heterozygous pairs. The index of antigenic similarity of parents varied from 0.1 to 0.8. If the antigenic similarity of the mated animals was 10 %, significant losses of calves were observed. If the antigenic similarity was 20 %, such losses increased but not significantly. The similar patterns were observed for the twinning. If the index of antigenic similarity of the mated animals was from 0 to 0.1, the maximum twins were born, and if the index of similarity was 0.2 or more, the number of twins increased, but gradually. Thus, the antigenic similarity of mated animals influences the number and survival of born calves.", "year": 2018, "openAccessPdf": null, "authors": [{"authorId": "4487708", "name": "O. Shatalina"}]}

Over the past decade, a rapidly growing number of this novel type of transplants have been performed worldwide with highly encouraging functional and immunological outcomes. Recipients of these grafts represent a new generation of transplant recipient pioneers. The uniqueness of their grafts, which include donor bone and its marrow, could help further elucidate the mechanisms by which transplanted organs and tissues are accepted. In turn, novel strategies to facilitate these mechanisms may be developed. The title of my talk today could be improved. A more explanatory title would be \u201cThe missing half of the Billingham-Brent-Medawar discoveries.\" This informational void caused a pervasive early error that precluded the orderly development of transplantation immunology and limited clinical progress almost exclusively to the development of more potent immunosuppressive drugs. To understand how an error of this magnitude could have occurred, it is necessary to go back to the birth of modern day transplantation. The midwife was the English Zoologist, Peter Medawar. The seed from which all else derived was Medawar\u2019s demonstration in 1943 that skin graft rejection is an immunologic event. In the next 10 years, efforts to weaken the immune response with irradiation or steroids had little or no effect on experimental graft survival. During the same period, however, a study by Medawar\u2019s team of the natural tolerance in freemartin cattle revealed a chink in the immunologic armor. In freemartin cattle, fusion of their placentas allowed mixture of the 2 animal circulations during gestation. After birth and throughout life, the animals shared each others blood cells (blood chimerism). Moreover, the cattle were tolerant to each others tissues and organs. Inspired by the freemartin findings, Medawar and his colleagues demonstrated in 1953 that similar chimerism-associated tolerance could be deliberately produced. In their experimental model, splenic or bone marrow leukocytes were infused from adult mouse donors into newborn mouse recipients whose immune system was not developed enough to reject the cells. With leukocyte engraftment, the neonatal recipients had lifetime tolerance to skin (or other tissues) from the original leukocyte donor, but not to tissues from any other donor. These chimeric mice were analogs of future patients treated with bone marrow transplantation for immune deficiency diseases. In 1956, Main and Prehn at the NIH extended these observations to adult mouse recipients whose fully competent immune system had been weakened with high dose total body irradiation before the cell infusion. These mouse chimeras were analogs of today\u2019s cytoablated human bone marrow recipients. Stable donor leukocyte chimerism in both mouse models was achievable only when the donors and recipients had a good histocompatibility match. Otherwise, the donor leukocytes were either rejected, or they turned the tables and rejected the immunologically defenseless recipient\u2014graft versus host disease (GVHD). Because human histocompatibility antigens were yet to be discovered, clinical bone marrow transplantation for the treatment of hematologic disorders and other indications was delayed until 1968. As in the mice, donor-specific tolerance was associated with the leukocyte chimerism. GVHD was the most common and specific complication that could be avoided or minimized only with a perfect HLA match. This was a beautiful story. The escalation of the mouse tolerance models to humans with parallel developments in histocompatibility research was heralded as a perfect example of bench-to-bedside research. In contrast, kidney transplantation with survival of at least one year was precociously accomplished in 7 patients between 1959 and 1962 without a preceding animal model: 2 in Boston and 5 in Paris. The first success was a fraternal twin recipient treated by the Boston plastic surgeon and future Nobel laureate, Joe Murray. All of the first 6 patients were irradiated before transplantation but had limited therapy afterwards because drug immunosuppression was not yet available. The exceptional seventh patient (also a Brigham patient of Murray) was not irradiated but was treated daily with azathioprine throughout the 17 months of graft function. Although the 7 successes were isolated exceptions in more than 300 failures, they were hailed as a collective breakthrough. However, the accomplishments were inexplicable. Engraftment had been achieved without donor leukocyte infusion, without HLA matching, and with no hint of GVHD.

Differential Susceptibility of B Cell Subsets and Mechanism of Induction", "abstract": "The notion of differetitial susceptibility to the induction of immunologic unresponsiveness is central to current concepts of self-nonseif recognition and the manner in which such susceptibility is translated into self-tolerance and nonself reactivity. Such differential recognition appears to be very dependent upon the stage of development at which a test of specific immune reactivity is made. Thus, Triplett (1962) found that reintroducedisologouspituitades of tree frogs which were removed prior to differentiation of the glands and allowed to mature in an etnbryonic host were rejected by the original donor. This experiment suggests that the critical event in the determination ofself-nonself in the donor occurred during the period of development when the pituitary was absent. It would appear that the immune system gained the ability to recognize self antigens by contacting these antigens before immunologic unresponsiveness was acquired and also prior to the time that a fully functional immune system developed. Moreover, early work on immunologic tolerance involved the use of immature animals. Owen (1945) observed that dizygotic cattle twins sharing common vascular supplies in utero developed into erythrocyte chimeras. Furthermore, Medawar and his colleagues (Billingham et al. 1953) demonstrated that these cattle twins were mutually tolerant of skin grafts from one another but would reject third party allografts. Billingham et al. (1953, Hillingham & Brent 1957) induced immunological tolerance as assayed by skin graft rejection by injecting/nw/ero testis, kidney, and spleen cells from allogeneic donors at 15-16 days of gestation or by transferring histoincompatible spleen cells into neonatal mice shortly after birth.

Data were collected on cattle that calved over a two month period (July and August 2009) on a dairy farm located in the Upper Midwest region of the U.S. Health and production data were collected daily for each cow from the beginning of lactation until the majority of the study population was confirmed pregnant.

These analyses showed metritis and dystocia in the first 30 days of lactation were associated with greater days to pregnancy. The only difference noted between parities was that lactation-five and greater cows were significantly associated with greater days to pregnancy. The two analyses showed conflicting significance of association between retained placenta, ketosis, twinning, lameness, and other non-specific illnesses with days to pregnancy. This study found that a competing risk analysis and a semi-parametric regression model were appropriate methods to analyze time sensitive data such as reproductive efficiency.

The discovery of immune tolerance and the recognition of self and nonself is such an event. It started with a 1944 letter from a cattle breeder in Maryland to the University of Wisconsin immunogenetics laboratory, reporting a curious pair of twin calves, unusual in having different fathers. RAY OWEN, a postdoctoral fellow in the laboratory and already interested in blood groups of cattle twins, thought they would provide an interesting opportunity for blood group analysis, so blood samples were sent to him. In the thirties and forties, the genetics of blood cell antigens was an active field for investigation. It was then a popular view among geneticists that antigens, because of their simple inheritance, might be immediate gene products. For this reason, they might provide an insight into the nature of that maddeningly elusive entity, the gene. In pursuit of this possibility, new blood types were actively sought in various species, including Homo supiens and Bos taurus. By the early 1940s, 40 different antigenic specificities had been identified in cattle. The world leader in cattle blood groups was the immunogenetics laboratory at the University of Wisconsin, founded by L. J. COLE and M. R. IRWIN (OWEN 1989). There was sometimes uncertainty about paternity in cattle, and when valuable animals were involved, that could be an important economic issue. Breeders and breed associations welcomed blood groups as a foolproof way of identifjmg sires. The immunogenetics laboratory provided valuable information and the breed associations provided financial support, vitally important in those pre-NIH/NSF days. It was a win-win situation. The events that led to the letter involved a Guernsey cow with twin calves. She had been properly mated to a Guernsey bull, but shortly afterward a lustful Hereford escaped from a neighboring area and got into the act. The color patterns of the calves showed clearly that the twins had different fathers. Blood analysis revealed that the COW carried (among many others) antigen G. The Guernsey bull had antigens S and X2, while the Hereford bull had R and 1\u2019.", "year": 1996, "openAccessPdf": null, "authors": [{"authorId": "2238820339", "name": "James F. Crow"}]}

Average daily weight gains of 570 g were achieved with an overall high dry matter (2.6 kg/100 kg live weight) and roughage (straw) intake (1.6 kg dry matter/100 kg live weight). The standard expenditure of energy and protein given for the stage of development was differentiatedly undercut. The energy expenditure being below the standard (ca. 10%), the total energy expenditure (kEFUcattle) was by 20 (II) and 25% (I) below standard expenditure. Energy expenditure aimed at weight gain reached very satisfactory values with 3.68 (I) and 3.79 kEFUcattle/kg weight gain (II). Protein expenditure fell short of the standard for the development stage by 14 (II) and 20% (I) resp. All parameters ascertained of the rumen and intermediate metabolism were in the physiologic standard range, as is characteristic of feeding regimes with a relatively high quota of roughage.", "year": 1985, "openAccessPdf": null, "authors": [{"authorId": "51324261", "name": "H.

Cortisone is known to have a profound influence on the activity of all mesenchymal tissues, and to this family belong not only the cells that mediate immunological responses, but also those that are universally and intimately concerned in the processes of repair. There is no acceptable evidence that the epithelium of skin grafts long survives transplantation from one human being to another, and in rabbits, mice, and guinea-pigs there is fully documented evidence that it does not. This general rule forms the baseline of the present investigation. It is known, however, to require at least three qualifying clauses. First, it has repeatedly been shown-most recently by Mclndoe and Franceschetti (1950)-that skin may be successfully interchanged between human twins of monozygotic origin, and also between mice or guinea-pigs of populations whose members, by very prolonged and strict inbreeding, have come to resemble each other almost as closely as if they were monozygotic twins (Billingham and Medawar, unpublished). It would be an almost inexplicable anomaly if this were not indeed the case. Secondly, skin may also be interchanged betweep twin cattle of unquestionably dizygotic origin (Anderson, Billingham, Lampkin, and Medawar, 1951). The majority of dizygotic cattle twins are known to have confluent foetal circulations, and to exchange haematopoietic cells which, although of genetically foreign origin, nevertheless endure into adult life (Owen, 1945). Such twins are therefore already genetical chimeras or \"graft hybrids,\" so it is hardly surprising that they are tolerant to grafts of each other's skin. This dispensation is not knowni to have any bearing on the fate of homografts in rabbits, mice, or men. The third qualification is of equally specialized import. The rule that skin cannot be interchanged between mammals of ordinary genetic diversity need only apply to orthotopic grafts of skin-that is, to skin grafts transplanted to posi-", "year": 1951, "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://europepmc.org/articles/pmc2068993?pdf=render", "status": "GREEN"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "3708552", "name": "R.

Increased knowledge about the principal causes of reduced fertility is essential. Increases in milk yield have been at the expense of reduced fertility in dairy cows and although diet has a major impact, the precise interaction between nutrition and reproduction still needs to be characterized in both beef and dairy cows. Furthermore, during periods of inadequate nutrition or stress, the intensity of oestrus is reduced by inadequate exposure to oestradiol. However, it is still unclear which pheromones are involved at oestrus, how synthesis is controlled and how pheromones are detected in herd-mates. GnRH may be involved in behaviour but the brain centres that translate hormonal messages are unknown. Attempts to overcome poor oestrous detection include measurements of milk progesterone, telemetric pressure detectors and devices that record the extra activity at oestrus. Substitution of heat detection by 'hormone treatment remedies' has met strong consumer resistance in Europe. The creation of larger cattle units and increased movements world-wide render herds more susceptible to infectious agents, such as Neospora, Leptospira, Trypanosoma and Bovine Viral Diarrhoea virus (BVDv), but it is unclear how other clinical conditions, such as lameness or endometritis, also interfere with ovarian function. The future of dominant follicles selected within 14 days after parturition is crucial--normal ovulation, prolonged persistence or atresia. Calving carries the greatest risk in the reproductive life of a cow and yet little work has focused on reducing the frequency of this event. For dairy cows, a greater understanding about induced or extended lactation is required. For beef animals, precise induction of twinning and nutritional adjustments could produce two offspring per pregnancy. At the start of pregnancy, the trophoblast produces interferon to prevent luteolysis, but the immunological implications are unknown and it is not clear how the rest of pregnancy is maintained. Profiles of pregnancy specific protein B (PSPB) have increased understanding of embryonic death. However, 25% of cows in abattoirs are pregnant, even though 30% of involuntary cullings are 'for failing to conceive'. Clearly, this is an area of wastage that requires urgent resolution. It is unknown why undernutrition at the time of insemination or in early pregnancy leads to delayed births, low fetal weights and later adverse health. At the end of pregnancy, the fetus controls the onset of parturition, but very little is known about the biochemical control of cervical dilation and placental separation. On the male side, bulls are selected for optimal freezability of semen; however, there is as yet no reliable predictor for semen fertility. Methods for accurately pre-determining the sex of both semen and embryos will revolutionize the dairy and beef industries.", "year": 2019, "openAccessPdf": {"url": "http://www.biosciproceedings.org/bp/0005/pdf/bp0005rdr1.pdf", "status": "GOLD"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "4926174", "name": "I.

Some problems were identified related to the main traits characterizing a stock of cattle. Reproductive problems were shown up.

On the other hand linkage disequilibrium (LD) mapping is taking the advantage of the historical recombination events to pinpoint gene location down to less than 1 cM. Meuwissen and Goddard (2000) proposed a fine mapping method using LD with marker haplotypes. The method assumes that LD resulted from a mutation that occurred at a QTL a number of generations ago. The method is based on identifying an Identity By Descent (IBD) region that flanks the QTL. This is achieved by estimating the covariance between the effects of marker haplotypes. The use of the method on real data has narrowed down the search for a QTL affect twinning rate in cattle down to a 3 cM region (Meuwissen et.al., 2001). Meuwissen and Goddard (2000) found that the method was insensitive to mutation age and effective population size. However, LD can also be generated by selection and population admixture (migration). Fine mapping is a resource-demanding step on which important decisions will be based (e.g. breeding and positional cloning decisions). The present study aims to investigate the robustness of the fine mapping method developped by Meuwissen and Goddard (2000).

Survival of calves with no dystocia was higher than survival of calves with dystocia: 8.6% ( P < .01) at birth, 10.8% ( P < .01) at 72 h, 12% ( P < .01) at 150 d, and 12.2% ( P < .01) at 200 d. The effect of dystocia on survival was greater ( P < .01) in twins than in singles at birth and at 72 h. Least squares means for dystocia were 20.4% in singles compared with 42.2% in twins. Most of the dystocia in singles resulted from a traction requirement (84.7%) of normal presentations, whereas most of the dystocia in twins (77.8%) resulted from malpresentations, with 59.2% of the malpresentations accompanied with a requirement for traction. Survival in singles ranged from 10.7% to 15.3% greater than in twins at different ages when there was no requirement for assistance in either singles or twins. Calves born as singles were 8.8 kg heavier ( P < .01) at birth and 28 kg heavier ( P < .01) at 200 d than calves born and reared as twins. Calf weight produced per cow calving was 53.1%, 54.7%, and 58.4% greater ( P < .01) at birth, 150 d, and 200 d, respectively, in cows producing twins than in cows producing singles. Cows producing twins had 65.2% more ( P < .01) live calves at 200 d than cows producing singles. Single male calves gained 74 g more per day than twin males from birth to 200 d, 45 g more ( P < .01) per day from 200 d to slaughter and 57 g more ( P < .01) per day from birth to slaughter. Differences between twin and single males in carcass traits were small. A sample of steers from the Twinning Project gained significantly faster and produced significantly more desirable carcasses than a sample of steers from a high performance reference population. Freemartins did not differ ( P > .05) from normal females in growth traits, but freemartins had higher ( P < .05) scores for marbling with a higher percentage ( P < .05) of USDA Choice or better quality grade carcasses and lower estimated percentage retail product.", "year": 1996, "openAccessPdf": null, "authors": [{"authorId": "143794884", "name": "K.

The contrast between uterine capacity and embryo survival is drawn; genetic and phenotypic variation havebeen demonstrated in other species. Other possible sources of variation, are the levels of steroid hormones and sensitivity to controlling hormones, e.g. greater FSH effects on ovulation rate in twin strain than control cows.

Sir James Simpson, a Scottish obstetrician, published in 1844 the results of his investigation: \" On the Alleged Infecundity of Females Born Co-twin with Males.\" He attempted to compare the fertility of the twins with that of mothers from the general population, and he concluded that, when females born co-twin with males are married, they are as likely to have children as other females. However, Galton (1876) in the course of his study of twins to distinguish between the effects of nature and nurture, accepted the view that twins do not marry as frequently as other people and are less fertile. Weinberg (1902) observed an effect similar to Simpson's, and from his Stuttgart data reported briefly that 110 female twins who had been married at least 20 years had 464 births, or about four each, a figure he considered normal. Since the turn of the century, very little has appeared in the literature regarding the fertility of twins. However, it is now accepted that human twins of opposite sex are always dichorial (Bourne, 1962), that vascular interchange between such twins is very rare, and that the freemartin effect is unkonwn in man (Hamilton, Boyd, Mossman, 1952). In the course of studying twins by means of genealogical records we have had the opportunity of obtaining data on their fertility. We have also noted that twin-producing parents tend to have high fertility. This paper is concerned with the fertility of both twins and the parents of twins. Source of data . The data were obtained from the records of the Genealogical Society of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints at Salt Lake City, primarily for the purpose of investigating the inheritance of human twinning (White and Wyshak, 1964).

The book combines rigorous logical analysis and ingenious proofs with a lucid, highly readable style and an engaging sense of humor. (Many readers may learn here for the first time of the Vatican cattle ranch in Montana, where visitors are advised to be circumspect so as to avoid being set upon by the papal bulls.) The first chapter presents the \"twin bases of Molinism,\" namely the traditional conception of divine providence and libertarian free will. The traditional conception of providence combines divine foreknowledge and sovereignty in reaching the conclusion that God is \"knowingly and lovingly directing each and every event and each and every creature toward the end he has ordained for them\" (p. 12). Flint has no difficulty in showing that such a conception has been widely held in the Christian tradition, and he appeals both to religious tradition and to philosophical argument in building a case for libertarianism. The combination of the two he terms \"libertarian traditionalism,\" and he maintains that for the orthodox Christian it is \"if not the only, then at least the best game in town\" (p 34). Notoriously, difficulties have been encountered in reconciling free will with the divine control of all events. Enter, in chapter 2, the Molinist account of providence, which shows how God can indeed control the course of affairs without interfering with human freedom. God can do this because of his knowledge of the\" counterfactuals of creaturely freedom,\" which inform him what each free creature would do in any choice situation with which it might be confronted; thus God can leave the creatures free while taking no chances whatever concerning what they may do with their freedom. In this chapter Flint elaborates the Molinist position with a good deal of philosophical imagination: we learn of the four \"moments\" of divine knowledge, of creaturely world-types, of galaxies of possible worlds, and of possible worlds which are feasible or infeasible, chosen, rejected, or culled. The third chapter addresses the main alternatives to the Molinist conception of providence, namely Thomism and the \"open view\" of God.", "year": null, "openAccessPdf": null, "authors": [{"authorId": "2262577333", "name": "Divine Providence"}, {"authorId": "2262583765", "name": "Thomas Flint's"}]}

First, the basic mechanisms that produce a single ovulation are examined. Follicular deviation is a critical new concept in our understanding of selection of a single dominant follicle. Follicular deviation is characterized by an abrupt deviation in the growth rates between the two largest follicles when the future dominant follicle reaches a diameter of 8.5+/-1.2 mm (mean and SD). The mechanisms involved in this selection process are not completely defined but appear to involve acquisition of LH receptors on granulosa cells of the dominant follicle, increased estradiol production by the dominant follicle, and inhibition of circulating FSH concentrations. Second, lactation number and milk production were found to be critical epidemiological factors associated with increased ovulation rate and twinning in dairy cattle. Finally, high steroid metabolism is proposed as the critical link between high milk production and double ovulation. It is proposed that high milk production increases steroid metabolism due to increased blood flow to the digestive tract and subsequently to the liver. The liver represents the primary site of steroid metabolism, and blood entering the liver is cleared of steroids. At the time of selection of the dominant follicle, the normal increase in circulating estradiol concentrations and subsequent depression in circulating FSH is blunted due to estradiol metabolism. Thus, FSH remains elevated for a time sufficient to allow follicles to undergo the physiological changes necessary to proceed to ovulation.", "year": 2000, "openAccessPdf": null, "authors": [{"authorId": "5122821", "name": "M.

The frequency of this syndrome is related to the frequency of multiple pregnancies, the number of which has significantly increased in dairy cattle populations (HF). Therefore, rapid diagnostics is necessary to enable early elimination of heifers with freemartinism from breeding. The aim of the study was to compare and identify the best method for early identification of freemartinism. The use of cytogenetic and molecular methods (PCR, short tandem repeats (STRs), real-time PCR) allowed us to conclude that molecular methods are more effective and guarantee fast and precise diagnosis. An additional advantage of molecular methods is the easy way to collect test material, which can be frozen, unlike blood samples for cytogenetic analysis, which must be fresh and delivered within 24 h to the laboratory, which generates further costs. Abstract Freemartinism in females born from heterosexual multiple pregnancies is characterized by the presence of XX/XY cell lines due to the formation of a shared blood system by anastomoses between fetal membranes of co\u2013twins and leads to disturbed development of the reproductive system, including infertility. The aim of this study was to estimate the most precise and effective diagnostic method, especially useful for early identification of freemartinism in young female calves. The cytomolecular evaluation results of 24 Holstein-Friesian heifers from heterosexual twins was verified by molecular techniques: PCR, short tandem repeats (STRs), and relative quantitative PCR. The molecular analyses have been found to be a more efficient testing strategy, with a higher diagnostic success rate than karyotype evaluation. In 21 heifers, leucocyte chimerism determined by the 60, XX/60, XY karyotype was revealed\u2014the proportion of the 60, XY male cell line in individual animals was in the range of 4\u201366%. In three cases, a normal karyotype 60, XX was identified, which indicates that anastomoses did not occur in 12.5% of studied twins and suggests that these potentially fertile heifers can be qualified for further breeding. The precise and early identification of freemartinism can be the basis for guidelines and selection recommendations concerning the reproductive performance of heifers born from heterosexual multiple pregnancies.", "year": 2019, "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://www.mdpi.com/2076-2615/9/11/971/pdf?version=1573726755", "status": "GOLD"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "1401591087", "name": "A.

Stormont13,14 demonstrated the occurrence of a large number of antigenic factors, determined by genes, on cattle red cells. At least 9 different loci were identified and the term immunogenetics was introduced for that part of science which utilises immunology as a tool for studying genetic characteristics and variation3. There was an obvious interest among European breeders and geneticists in taking up immunogenetic studies. It was expected to open up new possibilities for research in population genetics and to facilitate the search for marker genes influencing production or disease. However, the main reason was a very practical one: a real need had arisen for accurate animal identification after the introduction of artificial insemination (AI) around l950 for solving cases of disputed parentage in cattle. A few years later the storage of frozen semen convinced the AI organisations that accurate methods for pedigree control were essential. The author was very fortunate to have been at the University at Uppsala when a young graduate, Jan Rendel, returned from the USA to Sweden to start an animal blood group laboratory there. Eventually it led to the planning of a similar laboratory at Onderstepoort, which came into being in l956. With the support of Prof. H Graf, Dean of the Veterinary Faculty, and Dr R A Alexander, Director of the Veterinary Research Institute, Onderstepoort and Director of Veterinary Services, facilities were provided in the Old Hospital of the Institute and experimental animals allocated. The early work on cattle concentrated on the production of blood typing reagents. New types of antibodies were discovered in Afrikaner-cross cattle. Through international cooperation and exchange of test sera the South African laboratory was able to start blood group determinations for different practical purposes in 1960. The antibodies which are used to detect red cell antigens may be either \u2018normally occurring\u2019 or \u2018immune\u2019 in origin. Seasonal variation was observed in normally occurring antibodies, with the highest titres in late summer and the lowest in late winter. The possible influence of light was excluded by keeping animals in complete darkness, proving that the external temperature was responsible for this variation. A corresponding variation in antibodies against Brucella abortus to that in normally occurring antibodies could be demonstrated. De Vos recognised normally occurring antibodies against red blood cells in his investigation of immunisation with the Onderspoort babesiosis vaccine, especially after the 2nd inoculation. The value of research on cattle blood groups can be seen in the mushroom-like growth of blood typing laboratories. At a meeting in Uppsala in l954 only 6 persons studying animal blood groups, including the writer, were present. In 1972 there were 180 members of the newly formed European Society for Animal Blood Group Research, representing 48 laboratories. The AI organisations in South Africa were, from the beginning of routine testing, interested in the Onderstepoort activities, and the 1st cases of doubtful parentage were soon resolved. Until 1968 tests on 1068 of these cases were performed and 92.5 % could be solved. In a number of cases it appeared that the registration information was incorrect but breeders\u2019 associations tried to assure their members that the South African Studbook is as infallible as possible, using the latest methods available. The diagnosis of zygosity in cattle twins is of great interest to animal research. If twins have different blood types they are regarded as dizygous and if a pair is found to be identical in all genetic markers, it indicates monozygosity; 671 pairs were tested of which 20 % proved to be monozygous. Twin pairs of different sex are definitely dizygous. If the blood test indicates that no vascular anastomosis has existed between the twin foetuses and that the twins are different in their blood types, results show that l6 % of the females will be potentially fertile while 84 % of the remaining co-twins are sterile (freemartins). In South Africa, blood transfusions are mainly given to cattle suffering from severe babesiosis or anaplasmosis, when it is often the only means of saving the animal\u2019s life. In view of the unknown role of blood groups in producing transfusion reactions, research was undertaken in cooperation with Prof. K van der Walt at Kaalplaas. In single transfusions one need not be concerned about any real danger. However, the incidence of transfusion reactions is significantly higher in pregnant animals. In repeated transfusions no single blood factor or phenogroup appeared to be responsible for transfu250 Loveday Street, Muckleneuk, Pretoria, 0002 South Africa. ABSTRACT The introduction and wide use of artificial insemination in cattle in the 1950s led to a need for accurate parentage identification. Blood group determination by means of the newly emerging scientific discipline called immunogenetics provided the answer. A blood group laboratory was consequently established at Onderstepoort in 1956, initially concentrating on the production of blood typing reagents. Once established the technology was also applied to studies on a variety of problems in various animals as summarised in this paper. Investigations include zygosity in cattle twins, blood transfusion in domestic animals, breed relationships, genetic polymorphisms and the identification of useful genetic markers for production and disease parameters in breeding programmes.", "year": 2010, "openAccessPdf": null, "authors": [{"authorId": "2082096688", "name": "D.

They conclude that the beneficial effects of supplementation are apparent in both areas, although the reverse was true in the third cohort of SE England. They admitted that the design of the trial was unsatisfactory because ethical approval for the planned double blind placebo trial was not given. In my opinion, the authors have demonstrated the beneficial effect, not of multivitamin treatment, but of optimum conception vs high risk conception. The treated mothers were motivated and had intended to become pregnant, that is, they were supplemented for not less than 28 days before conception and up to the time of the second missed period. The untreated ones were seen too late, that is, they were already in the early stages of pregnancy, to be included in the cohort.1 2 While the former conceptions can be said to have been carefully planned the latter were either carelessly accepted (conceived during the restoration of the ovulatory pattern directly after an abortion or parturition or after a long fallow period) or they may not have been planned (resulting from inadequate attempts to postpone or to prevent a further pregnancy. This desire may be instigated by the birth of a severely handicapped child). In all these conditions the risk that the egg will be overripe before either ovulation or fertilisation is increased and, as in animal experiments,3 4 congenital malformations, particularly NTD, may result.5 6 Ovopathy as a possible cause of NTD is illustrated by a fetus with extensive spina bifida cystica, despite vitamin supplementation, resulting from an unplanned conception within three months after the termination of a previous pregnancy,7 that is, during the post partum restoration of the ovulatory pattern. Also, the recurrence of an NTD child (No 6, table 6') in a diabetic woman despite full vitamin supplementation may point in that direction. In fact, reduction of the ovulatory pattern was seen in pancreatectomised rats8 and amenorrhoea, menstrual irregularities, and malformed progeny were very common in diabetic women before insulin became available. In spite of insulin treatment, irregular cycles, delayed ovulation, and offspring with congenital malformations still appear to be more frequent in diabetic women than in nondiabetic ones.9 This may be due to a hormonal imbalance during egg maturation. We have argued that NTD, in spite of the inclusion of genocopies (for example, Meckel and Warburg syndromes) and phenocopies (as presumed by maternal hyperthermia during early pregnancy) fit the eight criteria necessary for assuming overripeness ovopathy as being the cause of a given disorder. 6 10 11(1) They do not or only rarely occur familially. (2) They occur concordantly and discordantly in monozygous twins, particularly in the smaller or weaker partner. (3) They are often accompanied by multiple congenital anomalies. (4) They are often accompanied by non-specific chromosomal aberrations. (5) They are often accompanied by hypogonadism. (6) They are often associated with a suboptimal reproductive state in the proband's mother. (7) They are often associated with high risk conceptions, illustrated by their unequal distribution with regard to maternal age, birth order, duration of pregnancy interval, hormonal balance, religious affiliation, socioeconomic status, month of birth, etc. (8) They are often accompanied by complications of pregnancy, birth, or neonatal life. For all these reasons, I believe that the areas of higher vs lower NTD prevalence correspond with those with more vs less conceptopathology, that is, better vs poorer prepregnancy care. And the apparent reduction of NTD after vitamin supplementation, particularly in the high prevalence areas, is only an indication of the beneficial effect of prepregnancy care, that is, optimisation of the conceptions for wanted pregnancies and avoidance of unplanned ones by optimum contraception.6", "year": 1985, "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://jmg.bmj.com/content/jmedgenet/22/5/411.full.pdf", "status": "BRONZE"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "3843225", "name": "P.

There are no estimates of the incidence of triplets in populations with genetic levels of twinning over 40% because these populations either have not existed or have not been documented. A model of the distribution of litter size in cattle is proposed. Empirical estimates of ovulation rate distribution in sheep were combined with biological hypotheses about the fate of embryos in cattle. Two phases of embryo loss were hypothesized. The first phase is considered to be preimplantation. Losses in this phase occur independently (i.e., the loss of one embryo does not affect the loss of the remaining embryos). The second phase occurs after implantation. The loss of one embryo in this stage results in the loss of all embryos. Fewer than 5% triplet births are predicted when 50% of births are twins and triplets. Above 60% multiple births, increased triplets accounted for most of the increase in litter size. Predictions were compared with data from 5,142 calvings by 14 groups of heifers and cows with average litter sizes ranging from 1.14 to 1.36 calves. The predicted number of triplets was not significantly different (chi2 = 16.85, df = 14) from the observed number. The model also predicted differences in conception rates. A cow ovulating two ova was predicted to have the highest conception rate in a single breeding cycle. As mean ovulation rate increased, predicted conception to one breeding cycle increased. Conception to two or three breeding cycles decreased as mean ovulation increased because late-pregnancy failures increased. An alternative model of the fate of ova in cattle based on embryo and uterine competency predicts very similar proportions of singles, twins, and triplets but different conception rates. The proposed model of litter size distribution in cattle accurately predicts the proportion of triplets found in cattle with genetically high twinning rates. This model can be used in projecting efficiency changes resulting from genetically increasing the twinning rate in cattle.", "year": 1998, "openAccessPdf": null, "authors": [{"authorId": "3111580", "name": "G.

Based on previous physiological observations, we tested the hypothesis that increased LH action [low-dose human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG)] before the expected time of diameter deviation would change circulating FSH concentrations, maximum size of the second largest (F2) and third largest (F3) follicles, and frequency of multiple ovulations in lactating dairy cows with minimal progesterone (P4) concentrations. In replicate 1, multiparous, nonbred lactating Holstein dairy cows (n = 18) had ovulation synchronized. On d 5 after ovulation, all cows had their corpus luteum regressed and were submitted to follicle (\u22653 mm) aspiration 24 h later to induce emergence of a new follicular wave. Cows were then randomized to NoP4 (untreated) and NoP4+hCG (100 IU of hCG every 24 h for 4 d after follicle aspiration). Ultrasound evaluations and blood sample collections were performed every 12 h for 7 d after follicle aspiration. All cows were then treated with 200 \u03bcg of GnRH to induce ovulation. In replicate 2, cows (n = 16) were resubmitted to similar procedures (i.e., corpus luteum regression, follicle aspiration, randomization, ultrasound evaluations every 12 h, GnRH 7 d after aspiration). However, cows in replicate 2 received an intravaginal P4 device that had been previously used (\u223c18 d). Only cows with single (n = 15) and double (n = 16) ovulations were used in the analysis. No significant differences were detected for frequency of double ovulation, follicle sizes, and FSH concentrations across replicates (NoP4 vs. LowP4 and NoP4+hCG vs. LowP4+hCG), so data were combined. Double ovulation was 40% for control cows with no hCG (CONT) and 62.5% with hCG (hCG). Double ovulation increased as the maximum size of F2 increased: <9.5 mm and 9.5-11.5 mm (7.7%) and \u226511.5 mm (94.1%). The hCG group had more cows with F2 > 11.5 (69%) than with 9.5 \u2265 F2 \u2264 11.5 (25%) and F2 < 9.5 (6%). In agreement, F2 and F3 maximum size were larger in the hCG group, but FSH concentrations were lower after F1 > 8.5 mm compared with CONT. In contrast, FSH concentrations were greater before deviation (F1 closest value to 8.5 mm) in cows with double ovulations than in those with single ovulations, regardless of hCG treatment. In addition, time from aspiration to deviation was shorter in cows with double rather than single ovulation and in cows treated with hCG as a result of faster F1, F2, and F3 growth rates before diameter deviation. In conclusion, greater FSH and follicle growth before deviation seems to be a primary driver of greater frequency of double ovulation in lactating cows with low circulating P4. Moreover, the increase in follicle growth before deviation and in the maximum size of F2 during hCG treatment suggests that increased LH may also have a role in stimulating double ovulation.", "year": 2022, "openAccessPdf": {"url": "http://www.journalofdairyscience.org/article/S0022030222003629/pdf", "status": "GOLD"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "1413856766", "name": "V.

While intake fluctuated from day to day, minimum daily intakes were large enough to protect from severe alfalfa bloat when it occurred.

Both lines were selected for similar direct yearling weight and maternal weaning weight EBV. Select lines were selected for lower 2-yr-old heifer calving difficulty score EBV and control lines were selected for average birth weight EBV. Select (n = 6,926) and control (n = 2,043) line calves were born from 1993 through 1999 and selection began with the 1992 mating. High replacement rates resulted in 2,188 births to select line and 598 births to control line heifers. Data used to calculate EBV came from these populations and from 15 yr of data preceding the experiment. Calving difficulty was scored from 1 (no assistance) to 7 (cesarean). Calving difficulty scores from all twins, malpresentations, and cows 3 yr old and older were eliminated. Except for the first year, when a single-trait BLUP was used, a multiple-trait BLUP was used to calculate direct and maternal EBV for calving difficulty score, birth weight, and weaning weight, and direct EBV for postweaning gain. Sires (n = 498) were selected from those born in both the preceding populations and the select and control lines. In purebred populations, some industry sires (n = 88) were introduced based on their EPD. Tests of mean select and control line EBV differences of calves born in the final 2 yr were based on population variation. Select line direct EBV were 1.06 lower for heifer calving difficulty score (P < 0.001) and 3.5 kg lower (P < 0.001) for birth weight than controls. Average differences for other EBV were small and not significant. Yearling weight EBV was intentionally increased in both select and control lines of purebred populations. Angus, Hereford, Charolais, and Gelbvieh yearling weight EBV in control lines increased by 32.4, 27.2, 21.0, and 10.5 kg, respectively, from 1991 and 1992 to 1998 and 1999 compared with an average increase of 2.7 kg in composite populations. Birth weight direct EBV in purebred control lines increased by approximately 8% of yearling weight EBV increases. Selection based on a multiple-trait BLUP was able to create lines differing in calving difficulty score and birth weight EBV, but not in weaning weight and postweaning gain EBV.

Twin cattle are normally synchorial, and cells circulating in the blood stream of the one have free access to the other through the anastomoses of the fetal vessels. Owen showed that twin cattle are born with, and may long retain, red blood cells of dual origin. In other words, each calf contains its own red blood cells mixed with a certain, sometimes high, proportion of red cells belonging to the zygote heritage of its twin. Since erythrocytes are end cells with a determinate span of life, Owen infers that the twins exchange red-cell precursors in fetal life and so become, and usually remain, chimeras. The experiments of Weiss and Andres (1952) provide strong support for this interpretation: they have not only shown (as Rawles and Eastlick had shown beforehand) that pigmentary melanocytes introduced into embryos of nonpigmented or differently colored breeds may survive beyond hatching, but, by using the intravenous route of inoculation, they have also shown that cells injected into the blood stream may eventually leave the blood vessels and take up their proper positions in the body.

The affected animals were from a south-east Scottish flock of 19 Cheviot gimmers and were both feeding eight-week-old twin lambs. The cases were first seen eight days apart at the beginning of June. The sheep had been kept on a well-drained, 7 ha field of average quality, organic, re-seeded grass and clover, which was also rotationally grazed for two days in eight by dairy cattle. However, it had been observed that despite an adequate pasture height of 6 to 8 cm, the sheep repeatedly attempted to escape from the field. The cattle were equally unsettled, being reluctant to graze, choosing to stand at the gate and bellow whenever moved on to the pasture. The field had been used for cereal crops or silage for the previous five years. A small amount of slurry had been spread on the pasture during the previous winter, accounting for no more than 30 units of potassium per ha. Only small amounts of slurry, but no artificial fertiliser, and been applied during the previous five years. Both gimmers were treated for suspected hypomagnesaemic tetany with subcutaneous injections of 80 ml of 25 per cent magnesium sulphate solution (Magniject; Norbrook Laboratories) and 40 ml of 33 per cent calcium gluconate/ 5 per cent magnesium hypophosphite hexahydrate solution (Calcibor CM40; Arnolds); they also received intravenous injections of 0\u00b74 mg/kg dexamethasone (Dexadreson; Intervet) and a three-day parenteral course of 30 mg/kg per day of procaine benzylpenicillin (Depocillin; Intervet) to cover other possible differential diagnoses. In both cases, the clinical signs did not improve and over a period of 10 to 12 days the gimmers became recumbent and unable to rise, developing periodic bouts of paddling, despite repeated subcutaneous injections of 80 ml of 25 per cent magnesium sulphate solution. The first sheep died approximately 10 days after first being seen. The serum magnesium concentrations of the second gimmer one and seven days after the first observation of clinical signs and approximately 12 hours after treatments were 0\u00b737 and 0\u00b717 mmol/litre, respectively. The magnesium concentration of lumbosacral cerebrospinal fluid collected from the second case, shortly after euthanasia due to a failure to respond to treatment, was 0\u00b752 mmol/litre, consistent with hypomagnesaemia. The diagnosis of hypomagnesaemia was supported retrospectively by the low pretreatment serum magnesium value of the second gimmer (0\u00b715 mmol/litre, normal 0\u00b77 to 1\u00b73 mmol/litre), normal haematology and normal serum protein values. A pasture macroelement imbalance was suspected, and the sheep were moved after the death of the second gimmer on to a field of permanent pasture, which had not been repeatedly cropped. No further clinical cases of hypomagnesaemic tetany occurred. Following the diagnosis of the second clinical case, serum samples were collected from all the surviving gimmers and analysed for magnesium, calcium, inorganic phosphate, sodium and potassium concentrations.A pasture sample collected from throughout the re-seeded field was analysed for macroelement concentrations by the Scottish Agricultural College Analytical Services Department. The serum analyses were repeated approximately four weeks after the sheep were moved to different pasture, when the gimmers were routinely blood sampled for maedi-visna serology and scrapie genotyping. The re-seeded pasture was severely sodium deficient (Table 1). Two of the 18 gimmers sampled when grazing on the re-seeded pasture (day 1) were hypomagnesaemic, as defined by a serum magnesium concentration below 0\u00b765 mmol/litre. Two different gimmers were hypocalcaemic on day 1, as defined by a serum calcium concentration below 2\u00b71 mmol/litre. Approximately four weeks after moving to permanent pasture (day 39), the serum magnesium and calcium concentrations of all 17 gimmers sampled were within the normal range. The serum potassium concentrations of 10 of the 18 gimmers sampled on day 1 were higher than the upper laboratory normal value of 5\u00b76 mmol/litre. On day 39, the serum potassium concentrations of 16 of the 17 gimmers sampled were within the normal range. The mean magnesium, calcium, inorganic phosphate, sodium and potassium concentrations are presented in Table 2. Naturally occurring hypomagnesaemic tetany is uncommon in sheep, with only 10 individual cases being diagnosed by Scottish disease surveillance laboratories from 1997 to 2002 (D. Somerville, personal communication). Magnesium reserves in the body are not readily available, so sheep are dependent on continued dietary intake of magnesium to meet their high metabolic requirements for lactation. Hypomagnesaemia results when the concentration of magnesium in the extracellular fluid falls due to the combined effects of high metabolic requirements, secretion into the milk and poor absorption from the forestomach. Magnesium absorption is related to both dietary magnesium availability and the permeability of the forestomach wall, which is influenced by oral potassium intake as well as other factors. Grazing pasture after the application of potash fertiliser or slurry results in an increased potassium concentration in the forestomach, which significantly reduces magnesium absorption (Morris and Gartner 1975). A negative correlation has also been observed between the sodium concentration of pasture and the incidence of hypomagnesaemic tetany (Martens and Schweigel 2000). Sodium is required for the active transport of magnesium. Furthermore, sodium deficiency stimulates Veterinary Record (2004) 155, 674-676", "year": 2004, "openAccessPdf": null, "authors": [{"authorId": "4884618", "name": "N.

The skin was hyperpigmented and very thin (2.4 \u00b1 0.0 mm, compared with 8.1 \u00b1 0.3 mm measured in four contemporaneous Jersey heifers). Histopathological examination of the skin revealed severe epidermal hyperplasia, orthokeratotic hyperkeratosis and diffuse follicular atrophy. Clinicopathological changes included hypocalcaemia that did not respond to calcium therapy. Serum parathyroid hormone (PTH) was not detected, compared with 1.38 \u00b1 0.78 pmol/L in four contemporaneous Jersey heifers. A diagnosis of hypoparathyroidism was made based on hypocalcaemia and low PTH in the presence of normal magnesium levels. The heifer was otherwise healthy and was allowed to continue normal life. A spontaneous abortion occurred at 5.5 months of pregnancy and this was likely due to the presence of twin fetuses. Despite targeted therapy of the ensuing retained placenta, the heifer declined in health and had to be euthanized. From the time of diagnosis with hypoparathyroidism until euthanasia (29 months of age), blood levels of calcium, phosphorus and PTH were regularly monitored. Calcium and phosphorus levels varied widely. Serum PTH was consistently undetectable. At postmortem examination, the parathyroid glands could not be located.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE\nTo our knowledge, this is the first report of naturally occurring hypoparathyroidism in cattle and with a clinical presentation of alopecia.", "year": 2013, "openAccessPdf": null, "authors": [{"authorId": "49754718", "name": "A.

Several less developed countries have promoted smallholder beef farming with twin objectives to encourage rural development and sustainable rural livelihoods. This study was conducted in Chipinge South Rural District, Manicaland Province, Zimbabwe, with the aim of examining the extent to which smallholder beef farming contributes to rural household development. An assessment was made to ascertain the level of household development for the sampled respondents before and after the beef farming project intervention. An embedded mixed method approach, which combines qualitative and quantitative approaches, was used in the study. The research made use of key informant interviews, focus group discussions, questionnaires, observations and project reports in the collection of both quantitative and qualitative research data. A multi-stage sampling technique was adopted in the study and out of a total population of 1740 farm households in Chipinge South, a sample of 174 farm units was selected from all the six farmer groups registered and operating under the Chipinge Livestock Development Trust (CLDT). In addition, 30 key informants were conveniently sampled for interviews among members of the project management, extension staff, and farmer committee leaders. The results from the study showed that smallholder beef farming enhanced the economic status of the smallholders which translated into improved household assets, better education, adoption of new technology, capacity building and improved food security, among others. While the beef farming project yielded notable benefits to rural households in Chipinge South, the project\u2019s ability to foster sustainable rural livelihoods in the long run was negatively affected by, among other factors, limited access to key livelihood capitals. The study recommends that the responsible authorities in Chipinge South Rural District urgently address the challenges threatening the sustainability of the project in order to promote long-term investment in the beef farming sector in the study area.\u00a0", "year": 2022, "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://www.scienceimpactpub.com/journals/index.php/jei/article/download/299/186", "status": "HYBRID"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "108042974", "name": "Jabulani Garwi"}]}

Corresponding phenotypic correlations ranged from .06 to .26. Genetic correlations between ovulation rate in a single estrous cycle and occurrence of twins were .38, .98, and .98, respectively, for 323, 430, and 283 cows with ovulation rate measured after measurement of twinning, in the same season as measurement of twinning, and more than 1 yr before measurement of twinning. Phenotypic correlations were .00, .07, and .OO. Genetic and phenotypic correlations among ovulation rates at six consecutive estrous cycles averaged, respectively, .66 and .12 for 610 heifers. Heritabilities for ovulation rates in individual cycles averaged .16. No evidence of negative environmental covariance between ovulation rates in adjacent cycles was found.

However more intensive management may be necessary during calving of twinas opposed to single-bearing cows, because of the requirement for more assistance at parturition to minimise calf mortality (Lambert et al. 1996). The on-farm practicality of intensive calving management for an extended period is doubtful. If spread of calving could be reduced, the high level of management input would be more acceptable to farmers. In this paper we describe work investigating the feasibility of synchronising calving of twinning cows. Hereford x Friesian and Angus x Friesian beef cows, 79 single-bearing and 48 twin-bearing as a result of nonsurgical transfer of two in vitro produced embryos, were calved at the AgResearch Ballantrae Research Station near Palmerston North in September 1994 and 1995. In 1996 thirty three singleand 16 twin-bearing cows calved, and in 1997 there were 28 singleand 14 twin-bearing cows. In these two years, half the singleand all the twin-bearing cows received a treatment designed to reduce calving spread (Bo et al. 1992). A longacting corticosteroid (Opticortenol) was injected seven days before anticipated mean calving date (AMCD) at 1 mg/25 kg liveweight in 1996 and at 0.5 mg/25 kg in 1997 (average pre-calving liveweight: single-bearing 525 kg; twin-bearing 547 kg). Cows were injected one day before AMCD with a short-acting corticosteroid (Dexol-5) at 25 mg/cow and a prostaglandin (Estrumate) at 500 \u03bcg per cow. Responses to synchronisation treatment were similar in 1996 and 1997 (Table 1). Average gestation length was shorter by six to seven days for singles, and by four days for twins (no data were available for nonsynchronised twins in 1996 and 1997 so comparisons have been made with 1994 and 95 results). Synchronisation reduced spread of calving from 14 to 16 days to six to eight days in singles, and from 18 days to four to nine days in twins.", "year": 1998, "openAccessPdf": null, "authors": [{"authorId": "72112847", "name": "M.

The primary aim of this study was to determine the frequency and features of XX/XY chimerism in female Rideau Arcott sheep. Also, breeding records were used to investigate the effect of litter size and sex ratios, as well as the genetic basis of the condition. Finally, the migration and transcriptional competence of cells of the opposite sex in the XX/XY female and male chimeras was explored. Genomic DNA (gDNA) from peripheral blood cells of ewes was screened by PCR for the male-specific SRY gene. Of 230 lambs screened, 10 were identified as chimeras. Litter size and sex ratio showed no statistically significant effect on the frequency of chimerism. PCR and FISH analysis confirmed the presence of opposite sex cells in female and male chimeras, and in the case of ewes, their migration to tissues other than blood. Transcriptional activity of SRY and AMH was detected in gonads of ewes, whereas XIST expression was detected in white blood cells of chimeric rams. It was concluded that the frequency of sex chromosome chimerism in Rideau Arcott sheep is estimated at 4.35%, with no significant effect of litter size and sex ratio. Moreover, as it was shown that opposite sex cells can migrate to tissues other than blood and be transcriptionally active in chimeric sheep, we speculate on the role they can play in these animals.", "year": 2008, "openAccessPdf": null, "authors": [{"authorId": "2103853427", "name": "M.

This interest has been inspired by a wealth of findings from the nonhuman literature. Studies of mice (Kinsley et al., 1986) and gerbils (Clark & Galef, 1994) have reported increased masculinization of the behaviors of females positioned between male fetuses in utero. Other evidence comes from opposite-sex cattle twins that display the wellknown freemartin effect in which female co-twins become sterile (Miller, 1994). Findings are mixed with respect to humans, but the weight of evidence does not appear supportive. Most behavioral researchers are, however, aware of the difficulty in disentangling possible prenatal hormonal influences from social-interactional effects. Elsewhere, I have suggested that this might be accomplished by contrasting the behaviors of same-age opposite-sex unrelated siblings (children adopted as infants into the same family who share rearing environments, but not prenatal environments) with opposite-sex twins reared apart from birth (twins adopted separately as infants, who share prenatal environments, but not rearing environments) (Segal, 2000). The only research more fully supportive of the prenatal hormonal exposure hypothesis found reduced frequency of spontaneous otoacoustic emissions (SPOEs: continuous tones in the inner ear intended to amplify the volume of weak sounds to make them audible) in females with twin brothers, relative to other female twins and non-twins (McFadden, 1993). Female twins did not differ in SPOE frequency relative to their twin brothers. This pattern of findings is difficult to reconcile with reference to the twins\u2019 social relations or rearing. Recent work by Danish investigators has extended this work (Gaist et al., 2000). Middle-aged twins completed tests of handgrip strength, height, weight, body mass index and weight circumference. Values were comparable among DZ same-sex, DZ opposite-sex and MZ twin pairs, thus contributing to the body of non-supportive evidence.", "year": 2001, "openAccessPdf": null, "authors": [{"authorId": "4357513", "name": "N.

Fraternal (i.e. dizygotic) twins originate from two separate ova or eggs ; thus, requiring a twin ovulation. The twin ovulation can occur on either the same ovary or one on each ovary. The U. S. Meat Animal Research Center (MARC) formalized a project in 1981 to evaluate the feasibility of increasing the frequency of twin births in cattle through selection of females producing fraternal twins (Gregory et al., 1990). Foundation females produced twin calves at an average frequency of 50 % prior to entering the project. In 1984, the selection criterion was expanded to include ovulation rate for 8 to 10 consecutive estrous cycles in all yearling female progeny (Echternkamp et al., 1990). Estimates of h for single observations of ovulation rate and twinning rate for the selected population were 0.10 and 0.09, respectively, and the rg between ovulation and twinning rate was 0.75 (Gregory et al., 1997). The h for ovulation rate in heifers increased from 0.11 for a single estrous cycle to 0.38 for a mean of eight cycles. Estimated breeding values (EBV) for twinning were calculated for each animal using a multiple-trait, repeated-records, animal model, which includes both ovulation and twinning rate (Van Vleck et al., 1991). A genome scan of DNA of progeny-tested bulls in the Twinner population identified a QTL on chromosome 5 for ovulation rate (Kappes et al., 2000) and QTLs on chromosome 7 for both ovulation and twinning rate (Thallman et al., 1999). These three QTLs have been used to compute marker-adjusted EBV and to select potential sires since 1998. The result of selection has been an increase in twinning rate of 3.1 % per year. Total weaning weight (adjusted 200-d weight) per cow calving was increased 55 % for twin versus single births (Gregory et al., 1996 ; Echternkamp and Gregory, 2002).", "year": 2002, "openAccessPdf": null, "authors": [{"authorId": "5758319", "name": "S.

With .1 \u00a3 10 IVF babies already born in the world, the efficacy of these techniques is beyond question. However, we must now fight for the safety of these procedures, since safety and efficacy are closely connected aspects. Figures from the Spanish National Institute of Statistics for the period 1982\u20132002 show that the rate of twin births has doubled, while there has been a 7-fold increase in triplets. From the obstetric point of view we know that multiple pregnancies are associated with a considerable increase in the risks for these patients. As for fetal risks, it is accepted that each additional fetus means a 3 week reduction in the duration of the pregnancy, with the result that levels of prematurity and cerebral palsy increase exponentially in a clear association with the number of fetuses. Nor can we overlook the significant increase in health care costs that arise in multiple pregnancies (Bertarelli-Spath, 2003; Bhattacharya and Templeton, 2004; Gerris et al., 2004). Although the majority of high-order multiple pregnancies come from ovulation induction or enhancement treatment (Tur et al., 2005), the large majority of twin or triple pregnancies have their origin in IVF (Jain et al., 2004; Nyboe Andersen et al., 2004). This is the very technique in which prevention can be practised clearly and directly by limiting the number of embryos to be transferred, thus optimizing efficiency without increasing risks. Talk of crude pregnancy rates is now obsolete and we must incorporate new parameters such as the BESST score (birth emphasizing a successful singleton at term), which shows the percentage of live term birth of singleton baby per assisted reproduction treatment cycle begun (Min et al., 2004). However, the good results of modern obstetrics mean that twin pregnancies are medically acceptable and so, as with single pregnancies, they can be considered as successes for assisted reproduction treatment (Dickey et al., 2004). In recent years and thanks to the pioneering work of the Scandinavian teams (Vilska et al., 1999) policies of limiting the number of embryos to transfer have proliferated. In young patients it is possible to perform selectively one elective single embryo transfer (ESET) or double embryo transfer (DET) without the pregnancy rates being noticeably affected (Heijnen et al., 2004). Nevertheless, it is obvious that for widespread application of these strategies an IVF team has to have an outstanding performance accompanied by an excellent embryofreezing programme, and must not suffer legal restrictions to embryo freezing as currently happens in some European countries. If these conditions exist, I feel that this is the time for evaluation of the quality of a programme not only in terms of implantation rates but of the percentage of cycles in which ESET is applied (Land and Evers, 2004; Ombelet et al., 2005). With a view to having objective criteria as to the advisability of transferring one, two or three embryos, we have designed a multiple pregnancy score (MPS) based on the retrospective analysis of our own material. After the application of the appropriate statistical methodology by means of receiver operating curves (ROC) we were able to identify that the parameters most closely connected with the establishment of a multiple pregnancy were the age of the patient (#34 years) and the total number of high quality embryos that were available for replacement ($2); high MPS values make it advisable to transfer fewer embryos (Table I) (Barri et al., 2004). The utility of this lies in the fact that it makes it possible to base the decision as to the number of embryos to be transferred on objective criteria, thus avoiding subjective bias on the part of the doctor or of the patient. I am convinced that if a programme has implantation rates of .25% and pregnancy rates by cryoreplacement .35% then there is an obligation to apply restrictive policies on the number of embryos to transfer. In our programme we have never transferred more than three embryos in the last 3 years. We have ESET rates of 30%, and 45% for DET, and three embryos are transferred in 25% of the IVF cycles. According to the experience acquired when applying the MPS based on these criteria of patient\u2019s age and total number of top quality embryos, we have been able to design a more restrictive policy of embryo replacement.

Over the past 30 years, the growth in uptake of IVF in this country has been remarkable, with nearly 4% of all live births resulting from this mode of conception.1 This is associated with a loss of stigma surrounding infertility and the increased acceptability of IVF as a treatment option. Technologies such as intracytoplasmic sperm injection, use of donor gametes and embryos, preimplantation genetic diagnosis, improved access through an expansion of clinics, and the rapid commercialisation of the industry have all combined to expand services available to patients. One of the international blights on the practice of IVF has been the very high multiple pregnancy rate that has resulted from economic pressures due to the expense of the technology (as seen in the United States and parts of Europe) or the relatively poor chance of one embryo producing a pregnancy (as seen in many developing nations). Large numbers of twins, triplets or higher-order multiples are conceived, and the consequences for the pregnancy and perinatal life are suboptimal.2 Even in Australia, the perinatal mortality rate for IVF multiple births is 32.1 per 1000, compared with 15.3 per 1000 for singleton babies born by IVF and 10.2 per 1000 for all babies born in Australia.1 There are also significant longterm health, social and economic consequences of multiple births.3 Unlike in some parts of the world, selective fetal reduction is not widely used in these circumstances. The close proximity of fertility clinics to major obstetric hospitals, with joint appointments of fertility specialists, led to a strong desire in Australia to reduce multiple pregnancies to the lowest level achievable. Coupled with advances in embryo culture and ovarian stimulation, key Australian clinics started to move to single embryo transfer a decade ago. Indeed, a large clinical trial of single versus double embryo transfer (ASSET: the Australian Study of Single Embryo Transfer) failed to achieve anticipated recruitment because the patient information sheet painted such a poor outcome for twins that patients were not prepared to be randomly assigned to receive double embryo transfer. With this change in practice came a dramatic reduction in multiple pregnancies, such that the rate has dropped from more than 25% to 8% across Australia1 and to less than 5% in some clinics. This has been achieved by self-regulation without any restriction on federal funding that would mandate single embryo transfer, as is the case in Scandinavia, other parts of northern Europe and the Canadian province of Quebec. Widespread acceptance of this practice has also occurred in New Zealand, despite a different funding model.1 From the evidence of a number of randomised trials, there is little doubt that single embryo transfer results in a lower pregnancy rate than double embryo transfer, but this can be compensated by the subsequent transfer of frozen embryos from the cycle, leading to the concept of \u201cas many embryos as you like, but one at a time\u201d.4 This means that cycle numbers per couple may increase, and adequate Medicare reimbursement must be maintained to allow responsible practice. The appropriate level of this contribution is constantly debated and has often been subject to political and economic scrutiny in light of the underlying pressures on health care budgets. In this issue of the Journal, Chambers and colleagues make a case for continuing this funding on the basis that the clear reduction in multiple pregnancies from the use of single embryo transfer partially covers the cost of increased IVF activity.5 They claim that the savings in public funding from the reduced need for obstetric and neonatal care for multiple births pays for around 50% of the financial costs associated with the increase in assisted reproductive services. The ongoing health benefits later in life are not factored into their calculations, so the savings are probably even greater. Multiple pregnancies remain a serious problem in several other areas of infertility treatment. There is little information in Australia on multiple pregnancy rates following ovulation induction with gonadotrophins or clomiphene citrate, or stimulated intrauterine insemination. Anecdotal data from reputable, experienced units show rates above the current IVF multiple pregnancy rates. In addition, the success of IVF in older women is much less predictable and, while single embryo transfer is widely practised for women under 38 years of age, the use of two or more embryos in a transfer in women over this age has received less attention because of their uncertain fertility potential. The development of non-destructive whole chromosome detection in an embryo and enhanced embryo selection through laboratory advances may help in selection and prediction of the number of embryos that should be replaced in these women.6 How much further growth will occur in the IVF market is uncertain, given that Australian IVF rates per head of population are among the highest in the world.7 There are Editorials", "year": 2011, "openAccessPdf": null, "authors": [{"authorId": "145792919", "name": "R.

Epitheliogenesis imperfecta and abnormal curliness of hair have been described in Ayrshire calves (3,4), but to our knowledge inherited forms of hypotrichosis has not been reported in this breed. A female Ayrshire calf was presented to the Atlantic Veterinary College with a history of congenital alopecia. The calf had been born full-term with a normal dizygotic twin female. The calf was ten weeks old at presentation, had a normal appetite and attitude, but was small for its age. It had a fine bone structure and was pot-bellied in appearance. The calf's cranium seemed enlarged and somewhat domed and there was evidence of poorly developed horn buds. Since birth there was generalized thinning of the haircoat with alopecia most obvious around the eyes and on the bridge of the nose (Figure 1). The alopecia was accompanied by dry, wrinkled and scaly skin. The texture of the hair was generally thin and fine but there were small patches where the hair was coarse and wiry. The calf was euthanized and submitted for postmortem examination. The skin lesions and other external findings were as described in the clinical examination. The only additional finding was that the cranial vault appeared disproportionately large relative to the size of the skull. The pituitary and thyroid glands appeared normal on gross examination. Parasites were not found on skin scrapings. Arthrospores were not evident on wet-mount preparations, and bacterial pathogens were not isolated from skin cultures.

These sex ratios cannot be affected by manipulating the environment after fertilization, except that in some frogs, Amblystomes and in Pleurodeles watlii, sex hormones can affect the results obtained by altering the K/Ca + Mg ratio. In rats, the proportion of males was increased to 58.3% by feeding female lactose diets (high calcium) compared to others fed a starch (rachitic) diet who produced 43.1% males.

The study aimed to identify SNPs on Indonesian cattle breeds and analyze their genetic diversity using Bovine 50K SNP chip. Twenty eight \"Ongole Grade\" (OG) beef cattle and 20 \"Holstein Friesian\" (HF) dairy cattle were used for the Infinium II assay test. This assay included amplification of genomic DNA, fragmentation, precipitation, resuspension, hybridization, processing bead chip for single-base extension, and imaging at iScan. Data and clusters were analyzed using GenomeStudio software. The Bovine 50K SNP chip containing 54,609 SNPs was observed spanning all chromosomes of bovine genome. Genotyping for the total SNPs was successfull based on Call Rate, GeneCall and GeneTrain scores. Most SNP markers had alleles that shared among the individuals or breeds, or had specific alleles at distinctive frequencies. Minor allele frequency (MAF) spreads equally with intervals of 0-0.5. The breeds of OG and HF tended to be separated in different clusters without considering their genetic history and twin or normal. This result suggests that most individuals are closely related to one another, regardless of the same breed.

Despite many studies, the causal mechanisms behind MOV are still not well understood. There is a general agreement that MOV are more likely during periods of low progesterone (P4), which may increase the luteinizing hormone (LH) release at the time of selection, resulting in more than one follicle becoming dominant. The MOV rate also increases in older cows and when the selection of a dominant follicle occurs concurrently with a high milk yield. Additional risk factors for MOV are ovarian cysts, diet, season, and genetics. A better understanding of the mechanisms underlying MOV may help to mitigate twinning, perhaps through the appropriate reproductive management protocols or genetic selection. Abstract This review updates the causal mechanisms and risk factors for multiple ovulations (MOV) in cattle. Clearly, MOV can lead to twin pregnancies, which negatively affects the health, production, and reproduction of cows. Therefore, a better understanding of the factors causing MOV may help to reduce twinning. Multiple ovulations occur after two or more follicles deviate and achieve codominance. The MOV rate is influenced by a complex network of hormones. For example, MOV is more common during periods of low progesterone (P4), that is, in anovulatory cattle or when luteolysis coincides with the selection of the future ovulatory follicle. There is also strong evidence for the luteinizing hormone (LH) being the primary factor leading to codominance, as high P4 concentrations suppress the transient LH surges and can reduce the ovulation rate in cattle or even inhibit deviation. Rates of MOV are increased in older and higher-producing dairy cows. Increased milk production and dry matter intake (DMI) increases hormone clearance, including P4; however, the association between milk yield and MOV has not been consistent. Additional risk factors for MOV include ovarian cysts, diet, season, and genetics.", "year": 2018, "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://www.mdpi.com/2076-2615/8/5/62/pdf?version=1525349660", "status": "GOLD"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "49757687", "name": "K.

In 'mulgas', most of the leaves point upwards, so that rain dribbles down the branches to soak into the ground beside the trunks. The Eucalyptus species that dominate 'mallee', on the other hand, present the branching aspect of a pollarded willow. None of these vegetation-types is exclusive, however. Spinifex may grow beneath 'mulga', and saltbush (Atriplex spp.), bluebush (Maireana spp.), or mitchell grass (Astrebla spp.), beneath 'mallee'. Soil nutrients are extremely low in concentration in this apparently climax vegetation. Although rainfall is so erratic, it is sufficient to maintain a surprising growth of trees (Fig. 2), which depend upon subsurface water. The numerous gaps in the MacDonnell Range even contain pools of blue water, most of which are extraordinarily beautiful. To the south-west of Alice Springs lies Palm Valley, beside Finke Gorge. Here Red Cabbage-palms (Livistona mariae) survive, isolated from all other naturallyoccurring palms by some 1,000 km of dry country. These Cabbage-palms are relicts from a wetter period, some 5,000 years ago, when the whole of Australia was covered with lush vegetation, including many palms; they have survived because the water-table is permanently not far below the surface of the soil in that part of the country. Many cycads (especially Macrozamia macdonnellii) are found in the various glens, gaps, and gorges, of the MacDonnell Range. They, too, are relicts from a period when the climate of central Australia was milder than it is today. These cycads resemble small tree-ferns, having short, thick stems with a crown of frond-like leaves. They commonly live for hundreds of years. The reproductive organs are in the form of separate male, and larger female, cones, borne on different trees. Like Red Cabbage-palms, cycads also rely upon sub-surface water. Heavy falls of rain are followed by booms in vegetation growth. These booms have traditionally been exploited to the maximum by cattle ranchers and sheep farmers, who have been blamed for over-estimation of the long-term stock-carrying capacity. The consequent overgrazing has resulted in erosion, by wind and water, of the bared soil. At the same time, however, it should be remembered that boom and bust are a natural result of the FIG. 2.

Burnet considers the clonal se lection theory, which has had broad im plications in cancer research and organ transplantation, his most important ac complishment. This hypothesis pre sented for the first time the concept of the immunologically competent cell, crediting clones and mesenchymal cells with functions of immunity and anti body production. Burnet's description of the clonal selection process under went many revisions; one version is re printed here. Burnet's investigations in immunol ogy were anticipated by Owen's obser vation in 1946 that most twin cattle are born with and retain throughout life a stable mixture of each other's red blood cells. In 1949, Burnet, collaborating with Fenner, explained Owen's findings in terms of a generalized theory of im munity. They postulated that the body's recognition of self is not inherited, but develops slowly during fetal life. They further predicted that an antigen experi mentally administered during embry onic life would not produce antibodies, but would be accepted as a normal com ponent of the body. This prediction was proven correct in 1953 by Medawar and associates in experiments with tissue grafts, thus giving birth to what Burnet terms, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153\u00bf the n w immunology.\u00e2\u20ac\u2022 Seven years later, in 1960, Burnet and Mcd awar shared the Nobel prize for their dis covery of acquired immunity.

Cows calving twins are at greater risk for many periparturient reproductive and metabolic disorders than nontwinning herdmates, and incidences of abortion, stillbirth, neonatal calf mortality, and reduced birth weight are greater among twin compared with singleton calves. Twinning is a complex trait with multiple causative factors, and empirical evidence supports a role for both genetic and environmental risk factors in cattle. Risk factors for twinning include genetics, season, parity, ovulation rate, and milk production. The observation that twinning has increased in the dairy cattle population over time suggests a concurrent change in one or more of these causative factors during this same period. At present, dairy farmers and their consultants are ill prepared to make sound-management decisions to mitigate the negative effects of twinning on their operations because of a lack of applied scientific data on management strategies for periparturient dairy cows carrying twin fetuses. A clear understanding of the factors responsible for twinning is essential for future development of strategies to manage twinning in dairy operations.", "year": 2001, "openAccessPdf": null, "authors": [{"authorId": "2469217", "name": "P.

It is estimated that more than 50% of the food necessary to feed the 9 billion inhabitants of the globe in 2050 will be produced by small and marginal farmers. Despite their key role in global food security, small-scale farmers continue to face many complex challenges. As a result, the agriculture sector continues to underperform. On an average, women comprise 43% of the agriculture labour force in developing countries, yet their access to productive assets is significantly less than that of their male counterparts (Crowley, 2013).Rudi Multi Trading Company Limited (RUDI) is an agricultural business owned and operated collectively by members of Self Employed Women's Association of Ahmadabad, India (SEWA). SEWA has designed RUDI as an innovative business model involving the rural women and women farmers to take ownership of their trade through their own investment. The business is based on the unique model of procuring raw agricultural produce from marginal farmers at market prices, adding value to that stock by cleaning and processing it before packaging and selling the products at affordable prices through a network of rural sales women entrepreneurs called RUDIbens {'Ben' in Gujarati means 'sister'). RUDI has about 2,02,000 farmers as shareholders of the company.The objectives of this paper are : (1) to discuss how a new for-profit organization (RUDI) owned by women is revolutionizing the distribution of farm produce in rural areas; (2) to discuss the impact of RUDI in making the intra-rural marketing exchanges more organized; and (3) to expound the benefits of the RUDI initiative for all stakeholders, especially the women.Initiative by SEWASEWA is a trade union registered in 1972 for women who are poor, illiterate and economically weak. The union was started with 320 initial members in the state of Gujarat. Its current member ship is 1.75 million from 12 states of India. Following the twin principles of simplicity and women leadership, SEWA seeks to strengthen village economy and self-reliance. Two third of the members are from rural and 60% are small and marginal farmers and labourers. The main objective of SEWA is to help provide full employment and self-reliance to women workers of the informal and the unorganized sectors. It has four types of self-employed women workers:1. Hawkers, vendors and small businesswomen like vegetable, fruit, fish, egg and other vendors of food items, household goods and clothvendors.2.

This category includes agricultural workers, cattle rearers, salt workers, gum collectors, cooking and vending workers etc.Most of the SEWA members residing in rural areas are small farmers and casual workers of lower castes or minority religions. They are socially, politically and economically marginalized. Unable to go to the market themselves owing to cultural restrictions, transport costs and the small amounts of produce they grow, women are often forced to have a family member market their produce or to sell it to a trader at very low prices. Their purchases (farm inputs) are often also mediated through traders or male family members (Crowley, 2013). On the consumption front, SEWA realized that small farmers and rural households lacked access to markets, especially for daily consumption needs. This resulted in health problems and malnutrition. Often, the farmers could not rely on what they produced themselves due to insufficient storage space at home. \u2026", "year": 2016, "openAccessPdf": null, "authors": [{"authorId": "98750703", "name": "P.

Ovulation rate and frequency of bilateral ovulations were examined by rectal palpation in 29,547 estrous cycles for 3,910 heifers (12 to 18 mo of age) in this population. Bilateral ovulations (one corpus lutuem [CL] on each ovary) were of interest because bilateral twin pregnancies result in decreased dystocia and increased calf survival. Ovulation rate increased linearly at a rate of 0.026 CL per year, and it currently averages 1.48 +/- 0.04 CL per estrous cycle. Concurrent with the increase in ovulation rate, the frequency of triplet ovulations increased from 0% to 2.3 +/- 0.8% (P < 0.001). Ovulation rate of both the right and left ovary increased equally at a rate of 0.013 CL per year, and mean ovulation rate of the right ovary remained greater than mean ovulation rate of the left ovary throughout the study (0.66 vs. 0.55 +/- 0.003 CL per estrous cycle; P < 0.001). Although correlations were low, ovulation rate of one ovary was negatively correlated (P < 0.001; r = -0.07) with ovulation rate of the same ovary in the previous estrous cycle, but positively correlated (P < 0.001; r = 0.13) with the contralateral ovary of the previous estrous cycle. The proportion of bilateral ovulations averaged 55.7 +/- 0.7%, a value greater than the predicted 49.5% (P < 0.001). In addition to dystocia and retained placenta, triplet pregnancies increase the incidence of pregnancies gestating fetuses of opposite sexes and subsequent incidence of freemartins; thus, selection pressure on ovulation rate may need to be adjusted in the MARC Twinner population. The proportion of bilateral ovulations in the population is greater than expected, and this may be an economically important trait, which will respond to selection and be beneficial for improving bovine reproductive efficiency.

The study was conducted on long term grazing trials on five treatments varying in stocking rate (SR; recommended (low) and 1.5 x recommended (high\u00bb, grazing system (continuous and rotational), and animal type (cattle and sheep). The treatments studied were CR (cattle, rotational stocking, low SR), CC (cattle, continuous stocking, low SR), CH (cattle, rotational stocking, high SR), SC (sheep, continuous stocking, low SR), and SR (sheep, rotational stocking, low SR). Rainfall during the two years of the study (1997/98 and 1998/99) was slightly below the mean average rainfall of the area (66 and 84% of the mean of 519 mm, respectively). Analysis of sward height data using Maximum Likelihood Estimation reflected a bimodal height structure in all treatments. Due to a high overlap of the two distributions in some cases, however, the height at which to separate patches (short grass) from non-patches (tall grass) could not be determined. Canonical Correspondence Analysis (CCA) was used to relate species composition to sward height. It emerged that there are two distinct grass communities at Kroomie, and these are associated with sward height (Le. patches and non-patches). The interface (in cm) between these two communities, as determined using Two Way Indicator Species Analysis (TWINS PAN) was 6 cm, and this value was subsequently used to discriminate between patches and non-patches. Sward structure was affected by treatments. Animals (cattle and sheep) stocked rotationally at low SR's grazed less than a third of the total area, and this grazing was concentrated primarily in small patches \u00ab 6 m; length is used as a linear indicator of patch size). Animals stocked continuously at low SR's grazed approximately half the area, in small and large (up to 40 m) patches. Animals in the CH treatment grazed approximately two-thirds of the area, in both small and large patches. There was an inverse relation between the size of patches and the size of non-patches, as expected. Nine common grass species were related to sward height. Digiteria eriantha, Eragrostis racemosa, Eustachys paspaloides, and Microchloa caffra were associated with short swards, while Cymbopogon pluronodis, Eragrostis chloromelas, and Sporobolus fimbriatus were associated with tall swards. Themeda triandra (themeda), the most abundant grass xi at Kroomie, was principally associated with tall swards, but was present at all sward heights. Applying CCA demonstrated a considerable difference between the species composition of patches and of non-patches. There was also a difference in composition between treatments, although these were not as pronounced. Patches reflected a higher species diversity than non-patches. There was a significant (P<O.05) effect of treatment, and of an interaction of treatment by sward structure (Le. patches and non-patches), on the density of themeda plants. The density of themeda plants was positively correlated with patch size, which suggested that themeda plants that have been grazed may suffer fatal competition from ungrazed neighbours. Anecdotal evidence suggested that patches are stable over the medium term, and that non-patches that are grazed during a drought return to a non-patch structure after rainfall. There was no evidence to support the contention that rotational stocking reduced patch-selective grazing, nor that the species composition of rotationally stocked treatments was better than continuously stocked treatments.", "year": 2003, "openAccessPdf": null, "authors": [{"authorId": "52395796", "name": "Du Toit"}, {"authorId": "97533481", "name": "J.

Four trials on methods of bloat-prevention vare described: (a) A comparison of \u2018break\u2019 grazing and normal \u2018rotational\u2019 grazing without restriction of feed in either case. Break grazing observations covered two and five breaks per day. (b) A comparison of these two systems where \u2018break\u2019 grazing involved restriction of area available to the cows, and \u2018breaks\u2019 varied from seven to eleven per day. (c) Comparison of \u2018off and on\u2019 grazing with normal rotational methods in an attempt to force changes in grazing pattern. (d) Comparison of the same pasture grazed at different lengths under rotational grazing methods. 2. Grazing behaviour and degree of bloat were noted. 3. In general, the results showed that, irrespective of number of breaks, break grazing with or without restriction gave no effective control of bloat. 4. There were definite indications that a strictly enforced system of \u2018off and on\u2019 grazing could afford considerable practical control. 5. Long feed proved definitely safer than feed of the same botanical composition grazed at shorter stages of growth. 6. It was found that cows on potentially dangerous grass had short grazing times with few periods of intense activity. Thus, the oft-stated opinion that bloat is caused by cows eating greedily of dangerous pastures was not substantiated. On the contrary, cows on such pasture showed marked reluctance in their grazing activity. 7. Bloat-producing swards were also associated with reduced rumination time, even in respect to cows showing no symptoms. Bloated cows showed generally very low rumination times. 8. Many of these observations were made on identical twins. From the similarity in their behaviour, it can be concluded that inheritance is an important factor affecting the occurrence of bloat amongst cows grazing the same herbage. 9. In the early stages of bloat, ruminal movement and belching increased in frequency and intensity. This is contrary to the theory that bloat is due to rumen atony. Atony was observed only in the advanced stages of the trouble.", "year": 1954, "openAccessPdf": null, "authors": [{"authorId": "143765675", "name": "J. Hancock"}]}

Mean calf survival rate of Israeli Holsteins from 2001 through 2008 was 0.85, and the mean economic value of survival to first calving was $526. Birth month, gestation length, dystocia, and twin birth significantly affected calf survival rate. Dystocia and twin birth each reduced survival rate by 0.034. Survival rate was highest for calves born in October and lowest for calves born in February. The difference between these months was 3.4%. Maximum survival was at a gestation length of 276 d, the mean gestation length for this population. Survival rate was reduced to 0.76 for calves born after a gestation length of 260 d. The individual animal model was applied for all the genetic analyses. Heritability for calf survival to first calving, as estimated by REML, was 0.009, whereas heritability of herd life from first calving was 0.15. The complete data set for genetic analysis of survival to first calving included 1,235,815 calves born between 1985 and 2017. Annual genetic and phenotypic trends for calf survival were 0.019 and 0.015%, respectively. Correlations of transmitting abilities of 226 sires born since 2010 for calf survival with the traits included in the Israeli breeding index were significant only for the maternal effects of dystocia and stillbirth. The GWAS analysis was based on the transmitting abilities of 1,493 bulls with genotypes and reliabilities >0.5 for calf survival and cow herd life. There were 7 single nucleotide polymorphisms with coefficients of determination >0.03 for calf survival and 12 single nucleotide polymorphisms with coefficients of determination >0.05 for cow survival. There was no overlap between the genome-wide significant markers for the GWAS analyses of calf survival and cow herd life. This corresponds to the conclusion from the REML results and the low correlations between the sire evaluations that the genetic control of the 2 traits are not similar.

All the above parameters were significantly affected except NEM by the contrasting climate conditions, particularly during July through August coinciding with early crop reproductive stages and maturity. The RFV values ranged from 70.4 to 81.6 and this lower range was attributable to nutrient translocation to seeds and higher lignification during plant senescence towards the grain filling stage of the crop as good quality hay records over 120 RFV.

Further, the feed manufacturing industry has embarked on a general program of expansion. There is a possibility of greatly expanding the livestock feeding industry in Montana because of a growing, demand for finished livestock products in Montana and on the Pacific Coast. The general expansion of the feed manufacturing industry brings to focus three principal problems. The first problem is related to the supply of barley and the necessity of making an economical disposition thereof. This disposition can be made through increased feeding operations for livestock, and also, in the case of the Montana industry, for the wintering of cattle. Then secondly, the feed manufacturing industry needs to have available the necessary information concerning the location, size, and type of plant arrangement best suited to the State of Montana. Thirdly, there is a need to make available detailed cost information so that the managers of plants presently in operation in Montana may better judge the efficiencies of their own operations. Most managers of the feed mills possess only a rough approximation as to total cost and little or no information at all concerning the cost of production at the several stages along the production cycle. In this research area, the technique employed was to determine the cost of production for six natural production stages in the manufacture of range cubes. A break-down of the research area of this study includes a stage-by-stage analysis which will allow plant managers to properly appraise their own operations in light of those reported. The stage analysis begins with each element as it enters the feed plant, and follows it through until the finished product is placed on the vehicle that will take it to the point of consumption. Perhaps the most interesting and revealing issue may be stated as follows: Within the present structure and under present operating conditions are economies of size present in the Montana feed manufacturing industry? It is generally contended that regardless of the size of the firm in the Montana industry the economies that will most enhance the profit structure of the firm are all internal economies. These economies can best be obtained by employing the latest technology available and constructing the physical plant lay-out in such a way as to maximize the return gained from the equipment employed in each of the six basic production stages.

Linkage information refers to recombinations within the marker-genotyped generations and linkage disequilibrium to historical recombinations before genotyping started. The identity-by-descent (IBD) probabilities at the quantitative trait locus (QTL) between first generation haplotypes were obtained from the similarity of the marker alleles surrounding the QTL, whereas IBD probabilities at the QTL between later generation haplotypes were obtained by using the markers to trace the inheritance of the QTL. The variance explained by the QTL is estimated by residual maximum likelihood using the correlation structure defined by the IBD probabilities. Unlinked background genes were accounted for by fitting a polygenic variance component. The method was used to fine map a QTL for twinning rate in cattle, previously mapped on chromosome 5 by linkage analysis. The data consisted of large half-sib families, but the method could also handle more complex pedigrees. The likelihood of the putative QTL was very small along most of the chromosome, except for a sharp likelihood peak in the ninth marker bracket, which positioned the QTL within a region <1 cM in the middle part of bovine chromosome 5.

This paper outlines the inheritance of twin born cattle, its geographic distribution and utilization for population accelaration as well as its contribution for meat supply. In Indonesia, twin born cattles are reported in 11 provinces and occured in Ongole crossbred (PO), Bali, Angus, Aceh, SimmentalxPO crossbred, LimousinexPO crossbred and FH breeds. The occurence of cattle with twinning birth in dairy and beef cattle is around 27.250 and 165.990 heads, with estimation 13.625 and 82.995 heads of dairy and beef cows, respectively. The optimistic scenario is expected to deliver 19.735 and 71.406 heads of dairy and beef calves every year, whereas pesimistic scenario resulting the birth of dairy and beef calves of 10.306 and 50.875 heads, respectively. These scenarios contribute to 2,6% and 1,8% of national calves born (3.500.000 heads every year) for optimistic and pesimistic scenarios, respectively, indicating that twinning genes in cattle do not significantly contribute to the addition of calves born in Indonesia. Several efforts to maintain the the population of twin born cattle can be conducted through option such as a) to maintain the twin born cattle population to the institution belongs to government or private; b) to allow farmers to raise the twin born cattle and c) to empower local farmers association as a networking who raise the twin born cattle. Eventhough the twin born calves contribution is low for national calves born, however, it is suggested to keep the genetic values for further requirement in the future, to provide technologies for early identification or moleculer of twinning cattle carriers as well as to explore the genetic potential for further development. In the future, development of the twinning cattle can be conducted through frozen sperm distribution for artificial insemination.Keywords: Beef cattle, dairy cattle, gene for twinning, heritability\u00a0AbstrakSapi dengan potensi beranak kembar memiliki frekuensi kelahiran lebih tinggi pada sapi perah (4\uf02d10%) dibanding sapi potong (1%). Laju pewarisan (heritabilitas) sifat kelahiran kembar sangat rendah, demikian pula dengan laju pengulangan (ripitabilitas). Tulisan ini membahas sifat pewarisan gen sapi beranak kembar di Indonesia, distribusi sapi dengan potensi gen kelahiran kembar, peluang pemanfaatannya bagi peningkatan populasi dan penyediaan daging sapi. Di Indonesia, kelahiran kembar sapi terdapat di 11 provinsi dan terjadi pada rumpun sapi PO, Aceh, Bali, FH, persilangan Aberden Angus, persilangan Simmental x PO, persilangan Limousine x PO. Gen beranak kembar sapi perah dan sapi potong berturut turut diperkirakan sekitar 27.250 ekor dan 165.990 ekor, dimana populasi sapi betina sekitar 13.625 dan 82.995 ekor untuk sapi perah dan sapi potong. Skenario optimis pemanfaatan gen sapi kembar , diharapkan dapat memberikan angka kelahiran sebanyak 19.735 dan 71.406 ekor, berturut-turut untuk sapi perah dan sapi potong. Sementara skenario pesimis menghasilkan kelahiran anak sapi perah dan sapi potong, berturut-turut sejumlah 10.306 dan 50.875 ekor. Kedua skenario tersebut menyumbang 2,6% (optimis) dan 1,8 % (pesimis) dari total kelahiran per tahun (3.500.000 ekor). Keberadaan sapi beranak kembar di Indonesia belum memberikan sumbangan nyata bagi peningkatan populasi, akan tetapi perlu dipertahankan keberadaannya.

A few years after graduating, he returned again to the Royal Veterinary College to obtain a degree in reproductive physiology. Ever since, Dr Willadsen has made a significant contribution to our science on numerous occasions and in several areas. His scientific work has been mainly in experimental embryology and embryo transplantation, with an emphasis on innovation and application.The work was originally aimed at developing new effective ways of breeding livestock and this is still one of its main practical objectives. However, since 1992, he has also given to developing techniques and insights of relevance in human assisted reproduction. Most of the problems he has worked on over the years, and hence the results of the work, have been of wider biological interest than selective breeding of livestock and alleviation of infertility in humans. Over the years he has experimented with oocytes and embryos of a fairly large number of species, including domestic cow, zebu, domestic sheep, domestic goat, horse, donkey, pig, cat, mouse, hamster, rabbit and human. During the period 1971\u20131973, he worked primarily on in vitro maturation of follicular oocytes in cattle. During the period 1974\u20131977, at the BritishAgricultural Research Council\u2019s Unit on Reproductive Physiology and Biochemistry, he successfully developed a process for efficiently freezing, storing and then thawing livestock embryos. The first lambs resulting from transfer of frozen\u2013thawed sheep embryos were produced by him in 1974, and almost immediately afterwards he showed that the method was equally effective for freezing certain stages of cattle embryos. Because one calf had already been produced from a frozen\u2013 thawed embryo in 1972, his were not the first. However, the procedure he developed was more effective, and the first frozen livestock embryos to be shipped internationally (from the UK to New Zealand, 1977) in compliance with all rules and regulations were frozen, thawed and transferred by Dr Willadsen.This allowed embryo freezing to be integrated into elite cattle breeding during the late 1970s and early 1980s. Perhaps more importantly, his work uncovered the general principles that govern the survival of mammalian embryos during freezing and thawing, and subsequently, former students and collaborators of his were the first to successfully freeze human embryos, using methods virtually identical to those described by him. The basic approach currently used in virtually all mammalian embryo freezing work owes much to this work. He has maintained an active interest in gamete and embryo freezing with special reference to human assisted reproduction. He was a co-inventor of a patented procedure for the freezing of single sperm (to be used in extreme cases of oligospermia) and a co-inventor of a patented freezing medium (to be used primarily for oocytes and embryos). During the period 1978\u20131983, he worked on various cellular manipulations of embryos, again primarily sheep and cattle embryos. He was the first to produce monozygotic sheep, cattle and horse twins of pre-selected parentage (in 1978, 1979 and 1980, respectively) by blastomere separation (\u2018embryo splitting\u2019). Willadsen attempted to divide the single-celled embryo of a sheep, mimicking Hans Spemann\u2019s work with frogs in 1902. He could divide the embryos, but when the individual cells were placed in sheep oviducts to grow, the original embryo division caused the cells to die. Willadsen discovered that a substance called agar could protect the embryos, and succeeded in completing the experiment. Willadsen\u2019s discovery of the agar coating technique allowed scientists to perform new types of experiments, because embryos could now be manipulated in drastic ways without the worry of damaging the embryo. Both this technique and his embryo freezing research proved to be instrumental in Willadsen\u2019s later successful cloning experiments. A natural extension of that work dealt with the development of embryos produced by aggregation of cells from two or more parent embryos, so-called chimaeras. Until then, such work could only be done with mouse embryos, as no other species of mammalian embryo could be successfully cultured in the laboratory.Among the most extreme results of his work with chimaeric embryos were animals that were sheep\u2013cow, and sheep\u2013sheep \u00d7 goat chimaeras. Effective methods for the artificial production of monozygotic twins and chimaeras of pre-selected parentage in a wide range of mammals resulted from these experiments. This work, which also included the development of an extremely effective procedure for culture of mammalian embryos, opened the way for even more radical micromanipulations of embryos in a wide range of mammals. Willadsen wanted his work to be used to increase the populations of endangered species by having closely related common animals serve as surrogate mothers in the births of endangered organisms. During the period 1984\u20131990 he worked primarily on the cloning of sheep and cattle embryos by nuclear transplantation. He was the first to undisputedly clone mammals by nuclear transplantation (sheep, 1984; cattle, 1985\u20131986). Following this success, Willadsen joined Grenada genetics in 1985, and used his technique to clone cattle embryos.

The retroactive reparations were assessed against the E.U. by the World Trade Organization after the U.S. and Canada prevailed in a prolonged trade dispute over the E.U. trade ban. However, hormone-raised beef products are still prohibited in the E.U., under an extensive agricultural reform policy aimed at improving food safety and animal welfare standards. The U.S., in contrast, offers scant protections for farm animals, and conditions on \u201cfactory farms\u201d have steadily worsened. Similarly, the U.S. food safety paradigm has been static for decades, its inadequacies underscored by the August, 2010 recall of almost 400 million eggs feared tainted with salmonella. The Beef-Hormones dispute is a bellwether for agricultural trade relations between the two trading giants, as domestic economic pressures inevitably lead to more of the same international trade bans on certain U.S. foods derived from animals. Unless E.U. food producers are compensated for the up-front costs of using production methods that incur fewer environmental and public health externalities, their products will not survive direct competition with less-expensive American imports. To preserve its higher food security and animal welfare standards, the E.U. must insulate its animal agriculture industries from these imports. Therefore, as E.U. animal welfare and food safety regulations are implemented more broadly, products derived from \u201cfactory farm\u201d U.S corporations will be less welcome in the E.U. marketplace. This article posits that the E.U. will ultimately prevail in a prolonged trade conflict borne of the diametrically-opposed policies, and that U.S. corporations desiring access to E.U. markets will have no choice but to initiate good faith animal welfare and food safety reforms, in the absence of legislative reform. Part I depicts the developing chasm between animal agriculture regulations in the U.S. vis-a-vis the E.U. Part II reviews the legal scaffolding on which trade agreements are built and disputes are resolved, illustrating the contradictory twin goals of supporting sovereign authority over domestic policies and enabling unencumbered international trade. Finally, Part III analyzes relevant WTO disputes and suggests arguments the E.U. might use to preserve its animal welfare standards and human health regulations, focusing on the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (\u201cGATT\u201d) and the Agreement on the Application of Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures (\u201cSPS Agreement\u201d). The article concludes that, irrespective of inevitable diplomatic and economic pressure from the U.S., existing trade agreements do not foreclose the use of trade bans to preserve E.U. reform directives.", "year": 2010, "openAccessPdf": null, "authors": [{"authorId": "91557553", "name": "P.

In Denmark, over the past decades, a series agro-environmental action plans have facilitated both significant reductions in N and P surpluses and improvements in the use efficiencies. Time-series of the relation between national inputs and outputs are reviewed, as indicators for the development, together with a methodology to map the flows of nutrients between the different compartments of agriculture (crops, livestock etc.), environment (water, air, soil) and the surrounding sectors (energy, fishery etc.). Furthermore, the perspectives for similar analyses to be implemented in other countries are discusses, based on the case of Portugal, and the current Nitro-Portugal project. Nutrient balances differ significantly between farm types (cash crop, vs. ruminant and granivore livestock farms), and so does the distribution between types of nutrient losses to the environment. An approach to distribute the farm N balance to different types of losses (nitrate to water, ammonia to air etc.) and soil-N changes is demonstrated based on results from the Farm-N model. Results show significant differences in the distribution in types of losses. For instance, cash-crop farms show negative soil-N balances, and relatively high Nitrate losses, while livestock farms show positive soil-N balances, with relatively higher ammonia losses from cattle farms compared to pig farms. Such analyses can be useful to better understand combined livestock and cash crop farming systems, and evaluate effects of potential intensifications, as discussed for the case of the Portuguese Montado System. Finally, we discuss the use of farm type modelling for solution scenarios analyses, based on experience from the www.dNmark.org research alliance and the NitroPortugal EU Horizon 2020 twinning project.", "year": 2017, "openAccessPdf": null, "authors": [{"authorId": "3485162", "name": "T.

III. Actively Acquired Tolerance", "abstract": "'Actively acquired tolerance' introduces into immunology the concept of a specific inhibition of response. Tolerance of a tissue homograft comes about when an animal has been confronted in foetal life with cells taken from its future donor, or from some other member of the donor's inbred strain (section 3.1). It depends (a) upon an embryo's inability to respond to antigens by becoming immunized, and (b) upon its continued inability to do so in later life. Methods for inducing tolerance in mice (sections 3.2, 4.1, 9), rats and rabbits (section 3.4), and birds (sections 3.3, 5, 7) are described in full. In normal development, response to an antigenic stimulus by becoming tolerant gives way to response by becoming sensitized or immune. The transition from the one modality of response to the other occupies a 'null period' during which the exposure of animals to an antigenic stimulus has no appreciable effect. Most but not all mice and birds at birth or hatching have already entered this transitional period (sections 4.1, 5). Tolerance is antigenically specific. An animal injected in foetal life with cells from a donor A becomes completely tolerant of homografts transplanted in later life from a donor B if, and only if, B contains no antigens that are not also present in A. (In practice, this condition is most easily fulfilled when A and B are members of the same highly inbred strain.) The reaction of a tolerant animal against a homograft from an unrelated donor is not perceptibly impaired. Tolerance does not, however, discriminate between the tissues of a single individual; the inoculation of foetal or newborn mice with leucocytes or with the cells of a mammary carcinoma may confer tolerance of later homografts of skin (sections 4.2, 9). Tolerance of a homograft is neither caused by nor accompanied by an antigenic adaptation of the grafted cells. An animal that is tolerant of a homograft in one part of its body is tolerant in another; tolerance is systemic, and a tolerated graft does not build up a privileged position within its own lymphatic territory (section 4.3). Every degree of tolerance is possible, from that which allows a homograft to live only a few days beyond its normal median expectation of survival to that in which it is permanently accepted by and incorporated into its host. An inhibition of response which is partial may nevertheless be permanent, for the weakening of the 'secondary response' in partially tolerant animals is proportional to the weakening of the first (sections 3.2, 4.4). The stimulus which confers tolerance must be fully antigenic, i.e. must be one which would have caused an older animal to have become immune. Cells such as erythrocytes which have no power to elicit transplantation immunity are incapable of causing tolerance of tissue homografts; all treatments which abolish the power of cells to confer tolerance upon embryos will also abolish their power to make older animals immune (section 5). Immunological reactivity can be promptly and permanently restored to a tolerant animal by inoculating it with cells taken from the regional lymph nodes of actively immunized members of its inbred strain. It may also be restored, more slowly, by the inoculation of normal unimmunized lymph node cells. A tolerant mouse thus retains in full the power to give effect to an immunity of adoptive ('passive') origin; a tolerated homograft continues to be a source of antigenic stimuli, and its susceptibility to a reaction directed against it remains unchanged. Tolerance represents a central failure of the mechanism of the immunological reaction, and is not caused by an intercession at a peripheral level (section 6). The relationship between twinning, fertility, tolerance and red-cell chimerism is analyzed. Like dizygotic twin cattle, twin chicks that arise from double-yolked eggs are synchorial, are red-cell chimeras, and are tolerant of grafts of each other's skin. Tolerance and infertility are not causally connected. The tolerance produced in chicks by artificial synchorial parabiosis from the 10th day of embryonic life until hatching is accompanied by a true persistent red-cell chimerism. The disappearance of chimerism in partially tolerant chickens does not reveal a return to normal reactivity, for their secondary response to red cells reintroduced by cross-injection is profoundly impaired (section 7). Some measure of tolerance of skin heterografts may be achieved by the synchorial union of embryonic ducks and chicks (section 8). Tolerance may be produced by, and in respect of, tumour homografts, and by tumour homografts in respect of skin. A degree of immunity which does not suffice to hold in check the growth of a tumour may destroy a normal homograft completely; the growth of a tumour homograft is therefore a less exacting measure of tolerance than the survival time of a homograft of skin (section 9). A naturally acquired tolerance of maternal homografts is believed to occur, very rarely, in guineapigs, presumably by the accidental incorporation into a foetus of maternal cells. No such natural tolerance has been observed in mice or rabbits (section 10). Phenomena cognate with tolerance are considered. The partial inhibition of transplantation immunity which is caused by injecting adult animals with variously modified antigenic matter differs fundamentally from tolerance in mode of origin, for the substances which enhance the growth of homografts after administration to older animals have no power to confer tolerance upon embryos, and the substances which cause embryos to become tolerant merely cause adults to become immune (section 11.1). It is argued that the iso-antigens responsible for transplantation immunity should be sharply distinguished from those specialized end-products of differentiation which are iso-antigenic because they are potentially auto-antigenic, and which are potentially auto-antigenic because the antibody-forming system has no opportunity in normal development to become tolerant of their action (section 11.2). The phenomenon of tolerance is considered for its bearing upon the relationship between mammalian mother and foetus; upon the different stages of development at which immunity to different antigens may arise; upon the antigenic and genetic composition of the different tissues of a single individual; and upon the fate of iso-antigens in normal life (section 11.3).", "year": 1956, "openAccessPdf": null, "authors": [{"authorId": "3708552", "name": "R.

Despite advanced ultrasound examination procedures, there is no reliable method to estimate the birth weight of calves in order to predict, prepartum, the risk of dystocia. The aim of this study was to predict calf birth weight and dystocia based on transrectal ultrasonographic (TRUS) examinations in late-term Holstein heifers and cows. Therefore, TRUS examination was performed on 128 animals that were between 265 and 282 d of gestation to measure the bone thickness of the fetal metacarpus (MC) or metatarsus (MT). Fetal TRUS measurements were successful in 104 cases. Excluding twin deliveries, 97 fetal MC/MT bone thicknesses were measured and the mean (\u00b1SD) MC/MT thickness was 2.54 \u00b1 0.37 cm. A novel index, the metacarpal/metatarsal index [MCTI = maternal body weight (kg)/fetal MC or MT thickness (cm)], was also calculated to study its association with calving ease. The average MCTI was 257.3 kg/cm in the studied population. A lower MCTI was associated with the risk of dystocia with an odds ratio of 2.074 that was not significantly different from 1 (95% confidence interval: 0.002-11.104). Fetal presentation, fetal age, fetal sex, body condition score of the dam, age of dam, and intercoxal and interischiadic distances were not related to dystocia.

Our results indicate that late-term measurement of the fetal MC/MT bone thickness by means of TRUS examination augmented with the MCTI may have clinical significance in the prediction of dystocia in Holstein cattle.

The occurrence of this misdiagnosis suggests that ECGs should be recorded simultaneously through multiple channels and that the recording should be repeated, since the fetal presentation changes as time passes.", "year": 1988, "openAccessPdf": null, "authors": [{"authorId": "2115498315", "name": "Kei Sato"}, {"authorId": "40580019", "name": "H.

Our father and grandfather built bridges, so we saw men driving pilings with a 40 foot pile driver and a 1,600-pound steel hammer and pouring concrete to make bridges. In the fall this equipment and a few bunk wagons were stored at the rear of our property, and we played in and around them with our close friends. The commu nity was white western European, Protestant, and Republican in politics. Much of our family social life centered in the Congregational Church, the Masonic Lodge, Order of the Eastern Star, and the American Legion and Auxiliary. In summers with many relatives nearby, we had large multi-genera tional family picnics at prairie lakes. Native to the Great Plains, I loved the bright sun, blue skies, waving grass, and wide horizons. Beauty was everywhere, even in violent thunder storms with heavy rains, lightning flashes, savage tornados, and harsh winter blizzards. I was one of its people and spoke their midwestern vernacular language. Instinctively, I knew how to use network ing through mutual friends to be readily accepted in a new community. On Sundays my father often took my two brothers and me to visit historic and archaeologi cal sites or to hunt gophers on the Coteau des Prai ries near our hometown of Clear Lake, South Da kota. We had a large family library, read maga zines, were interested in local and regional his tory, and collected geological specimens and In dian artifacts. Avid hunters, trappers, and fisher men, the out of doors was our playground in all seasons. From an early age I was fascinated by American Indians and eagerly read everything that I could find about them. Soon, I was a confirmed bookworm. Life was a great continuing adventure with new things, people, and places unfolding be fore my eager young eyes. Vivid impressions of the long drought, dust storms, and agricultural hardships in the Great Depression of the 1930s linger in my memory. Many of us small town boys went barefoot and herded cattle in roadside ditches to find green grass. We had a typical old swim ming hole, where we learned to \"dog paddle\" and were used to being chased over fences or up steep hills by angry bulls. Some farmers lost their farms through foreclosures and moved to town hoping conditions would improve. From 1930 to 1942,1 attended the local grade and high schools. I served for three years in World War II with two years overseas in Western Europe and saw ample combat as an infantryman. I was discharged in early December 1945 and returned to snowy, frozen South Dakota. In the fall of 1946, I used the Gl Bill to enter South Dakota State College at Brookings and studied there until spring 1948, tak ing many courses from Dr. Donald Dean Parker, a prominent regional historian. Then I went to the University of South Dakota at Vermillion and spent a day with W. H. Over and Elmer E. Meleen. Over had owned a grocery store in my hometown of Clear Lake, South Dakota, before World War I, so we had much to talk about. He was widely known for his years of archaeological work in South Da kota and was one of the founders of the Plains Conference for Anthropology. Deciding to major in anthropology, I trans ferred to the University of Nebraska at Lincoln, Nebraska, that fall. John L. Champe headed a small but active Laboratory of Anthropology, and E. Mott Davis had just joined the staff (Figure 1). Courses in anthropology and ethnology were offered, but field archeology was emphasized. Champe taught Physical Anthropology with Up from the Ape as a text, so we learned about our fellow anthropoids, human evolution, and our own human skeletons.", "year": 2006, "openAccessPdf": null, "authors": [{"authorId": "95425818", "name": "A.

However, there is variation among different countries. For instance, people in the developing countries consume an average of 32 kilograms of meat per annum, compared to 80 kilograms per person in the industrial world. Nevertheless, the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations recommended that minimum intake of protein by an average person should be 65 g and 40% (26g) of which should come from animal sources per day (2). The animal protein consumption in Nigeria was 15 g instead of 26g per person per day (3), which was far from other advance countries. For example, China\u201fs animal protein consumption was about 23 kilograms; Canadians an average of 65 kilograms and the US citizens consume 95 kilograms per person per day (2). Nigeria is not only one of the largest meat producing countries in Africa but also one of the largest meat consumers in this part of the world (2). However, the major challenges facing the livestock industry is bridging the ever-increasing demand and supply gap for animal protein. Most diets in the country are deficient in animal protein. Despite its large number of livestock estimated at 19.5 million cattle, 72.5 million goats, 41.3 million sheep, 7.1 million pigs, 145 million chickens, contributing 6-8% of the National Gross Domestic Products (GDP) and 20-25% sub sector contribution to the Agricultural (4, 5). Regardless of the huge and robust population of the livestock enterprise, the gap between actual and expected protein intake among Nigerians continues to widen, as the annual growth rate in livestock production continues to decline (5). Abstract: This study examined the economics of gestation termination in ewes in Maiduguri abattoir, Borno state, Nigeria. The specific objectives were to examine the magnitude of gestation termination in ewes, the chances of gestation termination in ewes, and the opportunity cost. The study utilized descriptive statistics in assessing the objectives of the study. The findings of the study indicated that total number of sheep encountered in Maiduguri abattoir between January to July 2015 was 15,620, while the number of ewes was 5,075 representing 32.49% of the total number of sheep encountered. The highest number of pregnant ewes (200 ewes) encountered was in the month of April corresponding to the highest number of ewes encountered in the abattoir within the period of the study. The probability of fetal losses among gestating ewes was 1.38, due to twining rate and that for every ten sheep, slaughtered 3 were ewes and for every five ewes slaughtered one was pregnant with financial loss associated with fetal losses in ewes equivalent to N18, 463,111 ($94,430.81) within the period of the study. The study therefore, recommends the need to create awareness through appropriate veterinary extension campaigns towards curtailing the slaughter of pregnant ewes. It further stresses the provision of ante mortem diagnostic facilities to ease the deterrence in the slaughter of pregnant ewes.", "year": 2018, "openAccessPdf": null, "authors": [{"authorId": "116695829", "name": "B.

Bunyaviruses are transmitted via a diverse range of arthropod vectors, as well as rodents, and have established a global disease range with massive importance in healthcare, animal welfare and economics. There are no vaccines or anti-viral therapies available to treat human bunyavirus infections and so development of new anti-viral strategies is urgently required. Bunyamwera virus (BUNV; genus Orthobunyavirus) is the model bunyavirus, sharing aspects of its molecular and cellular biology with all Bunyaviridae family members. Here, we show for the first time that BUNV activates and requires cellular potassium (K + ) channels to infect cells. Time of addition assays using K + channel modulating agents demonstrated that K + channel function is critical to events shortly after virus entry but prior to viral RNA synthesis/replication. A similar K + channel dependence was identified for other bunyaviruses namely Schmallenberg virus (Orthobunyavirus) as well as the more distantly related Hazara virus (Nairovirus). Using a rational pharmacological screening regimen, twin-pore domain K + channels (K2P) were identified as the K + channel family mediating BUNV K + channel dependence. As several K2P channel modulators are currently in clinical use, our work suggests they may represent a new and safe drug class for the treatment of potentially lethal bunyavirus disease. INTRODUCTION The Bunyaviridae family represents the largest taxonomic grouping of negative sense RNAviruses, with over 350 named members (1). The family is divided into five genera, Orthobunyavirus, Hantavirus, Tospovirus, Phlebovirus and Nairovirus and takes its name from Bunyamwera virus (BUNV), the prototype of the genus Orthobunyavirus. All bunyaviruses share common elements of virion structure being enveloped and containing an RNA genome that comprises three separate RNA segments named small (S) medium (M) and large (L). These three segments encode four structural proteins using an expression strategy that is conserved across all members of the family: the S segment encodes the nucleoprotein (N), the M segment encodes two glycoproteins (Gn and Gc), and the L segment encodes an RNAdependent RNA polymerase (L protein). Most Bunyaviridae family members including BUNV also encode two non-structural proteins; NSs from the S segment, and NSm from the M segment (2,3). Bunyaviruses are predominantly arthropod-borne viruses capable of infecting a wide range of hosts including humans, plants and animals. Four of the five bunyavirus genera include members that are associated with lethal haemorrhagic fevers in infected humans, and many are considered to be emerging pathogens due to a complex combination of factors including travel, animal http://www.jbc.org/cgi/doi/10.1074/jbc.M115.692673 The latest version is at JBC Papers in Press.

Bunyavirus emergence is facilitated by the segmented nature of their genome that allows reassortment between different species to generate novel viruses with altered pathogenicity (7). Schmallenberg (SBV) and Ngari (NGAV) viruses are orthobunyaviruses that exemplify this phenomenon; NGAV, which causes a highly fatal haemorrhagic fever in humans (8) is a reassortant possessing S and L segments from BUNV and the M segment from the closely related Batai virus (BATV) (9). Similarly, SBV, which is a pathogen responsible for teratogenic disease in sheep and cattle (10), has a complex genetic background possessing segments shared with previously characterised Sathuperi and Shamonda viruses (11). The threat of widespread arthropod borne transmission of these potentially lethal emerging viruses means the development of preventative and therapeutic strategies is urgently required. One strategy to identify new anti-viral therapies is to target virus host interactions that are essential for virus multiplication. Many examples of such interactions have been described for bunyaviruses (reviewed in (12,13)) and other recent examples include those involved in virus entry (14), counteracting the antiviral response (15-17) and modulating host gene expression (16,18). Another group of potential targets are host cell ion channels, which regulate ion homeostasis across all cellular membranes and are key players in a broad and extensive range of cellular processes including the cell cycle, gene expression, cell signalling and innate immunity (19-21). Ion channels are emerging as key factors required during virus replicative cycles, and have been assigned critical roles in virus entry, survival and release. Examples include roles for both potassium (K + ) and chloride ion (Cl ) channels during the hepatitis C virus lifecycle (22,23), the ability of human immunodeficiency virus proteins to modulate K + channel activity (24,25) and the recently identified requirement of two-pore calcium (Ca 2+ ) channels (TPCs) in endosomal membranes for successful entry of Ebola virus (26). Here, we report that BUNV multiplication depends on the function of cellular K + channels. Using the available ion channel pharmacological tools, a small family of twin pore potassium ion channels (K2P) was identified as the candidate K + channel family critical for BUNV multiplication. We propose that targeting K + channel function may represent a new, pharmacologically safe and broad ranging therapeutic strategy for this important family of pathogens. EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES Cells and viruses A549 (adenocarcinomic human alveolar basal epithelial cells) and Vero (African green monkey kidney cell lines) cells were obtained from the European Collection of Cell Cultures (ECACC) and maintained at 37\u00b0C in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEMSigma) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 100 U/mL penicillin and 100 \u03bcg/mL streptomycin. Huh7 cells (hepatocyte derived cellular carcinoma cell line) were a gift from R. Bartenschlager (Heidelberg University) and maintained under these conditions but additionally supplemented with non-essential amino acids. BSRT-7 cells (derived from BHK21 cells, that constitutively express bacteriophage T7 polymerase) were obtained from K. K. Conzelmann (University of Munich) (27) and maintained under these conditions but additionally supplemented with G418 (100\u03bcg/ml). U87-MG cells (a human glioblastoma-astrocytoma, epithelial-like cell line) were obtained from the ECACC and grown in minimal essential Eagle\u2019s medium (MEM) supplemented with 10% FBS, 1mM sodium pyruvate, 1mM non-essential amino acids, 2mM L-glutamine, penicillin G (100U/ml) and streptomycin (100\u03bcg/ml). All mammalian cells were incubated in a humidified incubator at 37\u00b0C in the presence of 5% CO2. Ae. albopictus C6/36 cells (a gift from L. Alphey, University of Oxford) were grown at 28\u00b0C in Leibovitz\u2019s 15 medium (Sigma) supplemented with 10% FBS and 10% tryptose phosphate broth. Working stocks of wild-type BUNV (provided by R. Elliot, Glasgow Centre for Virus Research) was prepared as described previously (28). HAZV (strain JC280, ECACC) was propagated in SW13 cells (human adrenal cortex carcinoma cell line, ECACC) and clarified supernatants were used to infect A549 cells. The titre of infectious HAZV was estimated by plaque assay; typical yields from virus propagation experiments were between 1x 10 5 and 1x10 7 plaque forming units per mL (pfu/mL).

(29). Viral titres were accurately determined in HEp-2 cells by a modified methylcellulose-based plaque assay with immunostaining using goat anti-hRSV antibodies (Abcam). SBV (strain BH80/11-4 provided by M. Beer, FriedrichLoeffler Institute) was propagated in Vero cells in the presence of 2% FBS. Drug treatments For the assessment of BUNV infection, 1x10 5 cells/well were seeded into 6 well plates and allowed 24 h to settle. Where indicated, cells were preincubated with the specific ion channel modulator for 45 minutes, or media supplemented with the solvent control of each channel modulator, prior to and during virus infection. Cells were infected at an MOI of 1 for 24 hours. Assessment of virus production by western blot analysis BUNV-N protein expression was assessed using the following method. Infected cells were lysed in GLB buffer (25mM glycerol phosphate, 20mM Tris, 150 mM NaCl, 1mM EDTA, 1% Triton X100, 10% glycerol, 50mM NaF) plus protease inhibitors (Complete; Roche). Cell lysates (50 \u03bcg protein) were normalized by BCA assay and resolved by SDS-PAGE, transferred to a PVDF membrane (Millipore) using a Bio-Rad Laboratories semidry transfer apparatus, and probed with a sheep BUNV-N serum followed by labelling with anti-sheep HRP conjugated secondary antibodies (Sigma). All Western blots were visualized using ECL system (Advansta). HAZV-N expression was assessed using a sheep HAZV-N serum before labelling with anti-sheep HRP conjugated secondary antibodies (Sigma). For HRSV staining, cells were labelled with goat anti-hRSV antibodies (Abcam) and anti-goat HRP conjugated secondary antibodies (Pierce).

In recent years he has managed agricultural research and development projects in the Caribbean for several international and regional organizations. He is currently the Deputy Executive Director (Development) of the Caribbean Agricultural Research and Development Institute (CARDI). \n\n\n\nLivestock development contributes to national agricultural output, so saving foreign exchange on imports, and can be a powerful stimulus to change among small and subsistence farmers. Small-scale dairying has been shown to be a harbinger of new disciplines and management practices that can be applied with great benefit in other agricultural enterprises. \n\n\n\nAgriculture in the Caribbean, in common with most ACP countries, is based mainly on crops rather than livestock. In the recent past, export crops have been predominant in terms of national priority and farmer prestige. Except in a few countries, livestock have been relegated to marginal lands and they have been farmed mostly in traditional ways to produce meat, hides and a little milk. Only in rare instances have they received supplementary feeding and other improved management techniques, such as pest and disease control on a sustained basis. Nor has livestock performance been recorded so as to permit more selective breeding and more advantageous feeding. Yet, in the Caribbean certainly, and possibly in many countries in Africa and the Pacific, the potential for improving livestock output is substantial and, with the improvement of livestock, comes the potential for the improvement of under-developed agriculture in general. \n\n\n\nAs a result of the Caribbean region's specialization in export crops such as sugar, bananas, cotton, cocoa, coconut and spices, food self-sufficiency has suffered and costs of imported foods have risen. Livestock products, and feeds for livestock, now account for 53% of the total food import bill. These imports include meat, and the full range of dairy products: liquid milk, butter and cheese. Grains and soya beans are also imported at considerable cost to feed the relatively modest livestock sector that does exist. \n\n\n\nOnly recently have we begun to realise that the Caribbean is quite capable of growing excellent pasture grasses and legumes and in addition has available a range of suitable animal feed from byproducts of our traditional export crops and their associated industries. Also, the Caribbean has long had its own breeds of cattle and sheep adapted to the region and with a proven track record as milk and meat producers: the Jamaica Hope and Jamaica Red cattle, the Barbados Blackbelly sheep and the Buffalypso, a beef strain of water buffalo developed in Trinidad. \n\n\n\nResource-poor farmers wisely avoid overdependence on any single farm enterprise and so initially livestock are required for more than one purpose: and in the case of cattle, for meat and milk. But it is milk production which may have the most interesting potential. Dairying is a challenge in that it requires high standards of management to breed and feed animals in order to achieve regular and sustained production of a sufficient quantity and quality of milk. Dairying also demands development of a collection, processing and distribution infrastructure if it is to go beyond the level- of localized self-sufficiency. But if these twin challenges (on and off the farm) are met, the benefits permeate other sectors of agricultural production, processing and distribution. \n\n\n\nExperience in Western Europe and in North America showed that the development of milk production for urban centres provided the financial, technical and management catalyst to farming in general. The most immediate benefit of milk production is the regular income it provides virtually all-year-round. To produce milk of saleable quality, disciplines of regular milking and hygiene must be practiced. Records must be kept to itemize milk sold and to identify high-yielding animals that need supplementary feeding and whose female calves should be retained for breeding. To be productive, pastures need year-round management including timely grazing, cutting for conservation and fertilizing. Since milk should be produced throughout the year, cows must be mated so that calving and lactations are spread. The farmer who is introduced to these disciplines will surely also apply them to his or her other farm enterprises. \n\n\n\nCARDI has identified three main problems that must be addressed if the Caribbean States are to achieve their potential in livestock production: the improvement of management of all classes of livestock, including control of parasites; the upgrading of livestock, particularly sheep and goats, by crossing with improved breeds; and the development of our pasture grasses, legumes and forage tree species to substitute for imported feedstuffs. \n\n\n\nA new generation of young people is entering agriculture in the Caribbean. They are open to new ideas and will respond to farming systems that offer the stimulus of more technical inputs in place of the drudgery of past agricultural practices. Where governments have provided the right incentives by managing imports and encouraging infrastructure, the signs are that our farmers are interested in developing livestock, particularly dairying, as part of their farm production and that, as a result, the entire farm output will benefit. \n\n\n\nThe views expressed are those of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of CTA.", "year": 1991, "openAccessPdf": null, "authors": [{"authorId": "100910171", "name": "H.

These sheets and their bounding thrusts all appear to dip beneath the structurally higher, Glenberry Lake thrust sheet, and are intruded discordantly in Spiller, Cattle, Horse canyons by the 86-Ma Cathedral Peak Granodiorite of the Tuolumne Intrusive Suite (TIS). The lowest exposed sheet contains rocks that probably correlate with the Upper Triassic and Lower Jurassic Koip sequence. The overlying six sheets contain a distinctive assemblage of metamorphosed calcareous sandstone, siltstone, mudstone, limestone, and interbedded silicic tuffs of the Horse Canyon sequence, possibly of Middle Jurassic age. Thrust faults expose mylonitic and schistose metavolcanic rocks, and the two lowest are marked by slices of periodotite up to several tens of meters in length. Locally, conglomerates with clasts of peridotite, quartzite, and metavolcanic rocks are associated with the peridotite slices. A sill-like body of granitic orthogneiss occurs along one of the thrusts. Stretching lineations in the most intensely deformed rocks plunge steeply to the east, suggesting dominantly dip slip displacement. The origin(s) of the peridotite slices are enigmatic, but the authors provisionally interpret the peridotite to have been intermittently exposed atmore\u00a0\u00bb the surface during thrusting, and the conglomerates to have been thrust-derived.

High yielding cows show a lower risk of culling than low producing cows. Cows with a lower milk yield have an approximately 2.7 times greater risk of culling as compared to cows with an average milk production. Genetic estimation of the length of productive life is possible in both large and small herds. In small herds the genetic effect may be affected by residual effects. Strong relationships with functional longevity in cows have been found for the mammary gland, feet and legs. The udder depth, rear udder and rear udder attachment have the most important effects on the length of productive life. Similarly, cows with a sound conformation of rear legs, the fetlock and feet reach a longer productive life. Age at first calving, herd size, and region of the country have a smaller effect on cow longevity; however, the recommended age of first calving is 24 months or less. The lower age at first calving is associated with lower production in the first lactation. Other traits influencing longevity of cows include calf mortality (average 8% and neonatal mortality of female calves of 3.4%), difficult calving, as well as male or twin births, high and low milk urea nitrogen concentration and lactose percentages, as well as inbreeding, which has a significant effect on reducing longevity of cows.

The frequency of occurrence of these anomalies in the total cattle population of the country is significantly less than in these herds which were studied. \n \n \n \n5. As the described anomalies of the genital organs are propagated principally by insemination bulls, bulls should be selected for this purpose only if their sires and dams have no history of throwing twins or genital anomalies. \n \n \n \nSchlusbetrachtungen \n \nUnter der Rasse \u201dUngarisches Fleckvieh\u201c kommt Genitalhypoplasie und Inter-sexualitat als erbliches Merkmal vor.

Daher mus zur Abwendung der erblichen wirtschaftlichen Schaden der Kampf in der Rinderzucht hauptsachlich gegen Zuchtbullen und gegen Kuhe gerichtet sein, die die Anlage zu Zwillingsgeburten vererben. Es durfen also in den Besamungs-stationen keine Bullen aufgestellt werden, die zur Milchrasse gehoren und die diese Anlage vererben. Zu diesem Zweck mus man die Fortpflanzungsanamnese der Bullenmutter beriicksichtigen: wenn namlich eine Kuh ofter Zwillinge gebracht hat, darf man den von ihr stammenden Bullen nicht zur Zucht verwenderi. \n \n \n \nUber die Genitalanomalien der gleichgeschlechtigen unfruchtbaren Zwillingsfarsen sowie der aus verschiedengeschlechtigen Zwillingsgeburten stammenden Farsen mit differierenden Blutgruppenfaktoren, des weiteren der mit Genitalhypoplasien be-hafteten Einlinge finden sich bislang in der Literatur keine Angaben.

A total of 1,014 observations of pronghorns during fall indicated a population composition of 26, 45, and 29 percent males, females, and fawns, respectively. Respective densities of 2.6 and 2.1 per square mile before and after the hunting season, together with an increase in the ratio of females per 100 males from 188 to 230 for the same periods, indicated a decrease in the population during the hunting season weighing heavier on males. None of four female fawns examined were pregnant but all four females older than fawns carried twins. Fat content of femur marrows, kidney fat indexes, and ratios of hog-dressed to whole weights for 12 animals examined from October to March indicated animals were in best condition during mid-winter. A Chi-square goodness of fit test was applied to a total of 4,478 observations of pronghorns, evaluated on the basis of habitat types used, indicated distribution was dependent on habitat types. Percent use of the Agropyron-Artemisia habitat type by pronghorns in relation to other habitat types increased from 75 in early fall to 100 by winter. Pronghorns used areas of progressively denser sagebrush from early fall through winter. Group size of pronghorns increased progressively from 6 to 55 for these seasons. Home range sizes determined for 11 individual pronghorns showed female home ranges were significantly larger than those of males. Fence types, classified according to penetrability by pronghorns, did not appear to hamper pronghorn distribution. A total of 39, 19, and 17 feeding sites of pronghorns, cattle, and sheep, respectively were examined and 19 rumen samples from pronghorns were analyzed to obtain food habits data. Browse was the major component of the diet of pronghorns, with forbs and grasses of little importance in fall and winter. Grass was the most important item in the diet of cattle and sheep, with browse a distant second. Artemisia tridentata and A. cana were important items in the browse component of the diets of all three species. Food habits data indicated forage competition between pronghorns and either sheep or cattle was minor, but use of pastures indicated an incompatability between pronghorns and sheep that could result in notable land use competition. Data suggested that pronghorns and cattle were compatible, and that joint use of range by these species in this area could possibly result in better overall forage use than use by either species alone.

The US Meat Animal Research Center Production Efficiency Population has 9,186 twinning and 29,571 ovulation rate records for multiple generations of animals, but a significant number of these animals do not have tissue samples available for DNA genotyping. The objectives of this study were to confirm QTL for twinning and ovulation rate previously found on BTA5 and to evaluate the ability of GenoProb to predict genotypic information in a pedigree containing 16,035 animals when using genotypes for 24 SNP from 3 data sets containing 48, 724, or 2,900 animals. Marker data for 21 microsatellites on BTA5 with 297 to 3,395 animals per marker were used in conjunction with each data set of genotyped animals. Genotypic probabilities for females were used to calculate independent variables for regressions of additive, dominance, and imprinting effects. Genotypic regressions were fitted as fixed effects in a 2-trait mixed model analysis by using multiple-trait derivative-free REML. Each SNP was analyzed individually, followed by backward selection fitting all individually significant SNP simultaneously and then removing the least significant SNP until only significant SNP were left. Five significant SNP associations were detected for twinning rate and 3 were detected for ovulation rate. Two of these SNP, 1 for each trait, were significant for imprinting. Additional modeling of paternal and maternal allelic effects confirmed the initial results of imprinting done by contrasting heterozygotes. These results are supported by comparative mapping of mouse and human imprinted genes to this region of bovine chromosome 5.", "year": 2009, "openAccessPdf": null, "authors": [{"authorId": "144692668", "name": "M.

In Exp. 1, Angus heifers (n = 50) received a 7-d Ovsynch + progesterone protocol (on d 0, GnRH and progesterone insert were administered; on d 7, progesterone insert was removed and PGF2\u03b1 was injected; and on d 9.5, GnRH was injected 56 h after progesterone removal) with eCG (0, 300, 500, 700, or 1,000 IU) administered on d 7. In Exp. 2, Angus cows (n = 27) received the same protocol as Exp. 1 and were assigned randomly to receive 0 or 400 IU eCG i.m. on d 2 or 7. In Exp. 3, Angus cows (n = 18) received a 6-d Ovsynch + progesterone protocol and were randomly assigned to receive 0 or 800 IU eCG on d 3 of the protocol (Exp. 3a). A pilot field trial was also performed using the same treatments in suckled Angus-cross cows (n = 72; Exp. 3b). In Exp. 4, beef heifers (n = 200) were assigned randomly to the same treatments as in Exp. 3, but the second GnRH was not given, with Holstein bulls introduced on d 6. In Exp. 5, Angus cows (n = 12) received the same treatment as in Exp. 3, but were not inseminated. Progesterone concentrations were assessed in plasma collected during the estrous cycle following synchronization. Ultrasonography was used to monitor ovarian dynamics and to diagnose pregnancy. In Exp. 1, the mean number of ovulations was affected (P < 0.02) by the dose of eCG and the stage of follicular development when administered. Treatment with eCG on d 2 tended (P < 0.08) to extend the interval from PGF2\u03b1 to ovulation, but was not successful in inducing double ovulations. In contrast, eCG on d 3 increased (P < 0.01) the number of cows with double ovulation when administered i.m. and increased (P < 0.04) pregnancy rate in single ovulating heifers after bull breeding (68.0 vs. 53.1%). This treatment also elevated progesterone concentrations during the estrous cycle following synchronization. Thus, the mechanism by which administration of eCG on d 3 of the synchronization increased pregnancy rates may be through supporting development of a healthy follicle and subsequent corpus luteum capable of secreting increased concentrations of progesterone during early pregnancy. In conclusion, strategic administration of eCG during a synchronization protocol can be used to improve reproductive performance through increased pregnancy rates in single ovulating animals as well as the induction of twin ovulations for twinning.", "year": 2014, "openAccessPdf": null, "authors": [{"authorId": "2219748191", "name": "M.

In certain of the cases cited as examples, there must remain a doubt as to which of these arbitrarily chosen classes, genotypical and physiological, the particular example belongs until more is known of the genetics of the form, and of the mechanism concerned in the processes of developmental physiology. It is solely in order to ease discussion that this legitimate rigid classification has been adopted. I. Through the action of a foreign biochemical agency. (a) The case of the bovine free-martin. Twins are not uncommon in cattle. They may be two perfectly normal males, two normal females, one male and one female, both normal, or one normal male and an individual which is abnormal in its sex organization, and in this alone. The questions to be considered are these: (i) Are twins in cattle identical or fraternal, i.e., do they havetheir origin in one and the same zygote or in two separately fertilized ova? If they are identical, then the sexually abnormal individual must be a genotypic male, i.e., of the same sex as its normal co-twin; if the twins are fraternal, then the abnormal individual may be either male or female, genotypically. (2) How is this abnormality produced? The earlier investigators who had examined the case of the bovine free-martin had regarded the abnormal individual as an identical twin, and, therefore, as a genotypic male (Spiegelberg, Hart, Bateson, and Cole). However, in all save one of iz26 cases of twins in cattle thoroughly examined by Lillie, two corpora litea were found. The inference is that twins are almost invariably binovular in this animal, since two ova are concerned in such pregnancies; for when an ovum is discharged from the mammalian ovary, the scar tissue of the ruptured follicle remains as a glandular structure known as the corpus luteum. The two fertilized ova pass into the bicornuate uterus and become attached to the uterine mucosa. As the zygotes increase in size, the embryonic membranes of the two fetuses meet to adhere and in many cases to fuse. If such fusion occurs, an anastomosis (intermingling) of their blood vessels can result, so that a common vascular intercommunication may become established.", "year": 1927, "openAccessPdf": null, "authors": [{"authorId": "8132817", "name": "F.

In this analysis we have taken three outer membrane proteins (vacJ, ompW and skp) from P. multocida which are involved in infectious diseases of animals and birds. The literature shows that all three outer membrane proteins are infectious in nature. This is supported by multiple sequence alignment and analysis of physicochemical properties of protein sequences encoded by vacJ, ompW and skp outer membrane protein families. The studied proteins are similar with respect to number of positively and negatively charged amino acids, molecular weight, Theoretical pI, instability index and grand average of hydropathicity (Gravy) in the proteins from P. multocida strains infecting different genera.

A total of fifty-two heifers was used in an egg transfer experiment to study methods of inducing twinning in cattle. Two groups of eleven recipients were made pregnant to determine the effect of either transferring two eggs to a single uterine horn or one egg to each. Seven animals in each group were slaughtered and the remaining four allowed to go to term. Of the heifers into which two eggs were transferred to a single horn, 73 % became pregnant and 45 % had twins at slaughter or calving. In a single case, one of the eggs had undergone transuterine migration and developed in the opposite horn to that into which it was transferred. Of the eleven heifers receiving one egg in each uterine horn, 73 % had twins and a pregnancy rate of 72 % was obtained in this group. A much greater degree of embryonic loss was thus found in the slaughtered group which had received two eggs to a single uterine horn. The number of cotyledons which developed was much greater in heifers with a bilateral twin pregnancy.

However, previous studies in animals have demonstrated that concentrations of residues of veterinary medicinal products may vary within tissue sites (Jansen and others 1989, Rose and others 1995a, b, 1996, Cooper and others 1998). In addition, human forensic studies on muscle concentrations from cadavers have also indicated a non-homogenous distribution of drug concentrations (Williams and Pounder 1997, Langford and others 1998). Factors which can affect the site and extent of the distribution ofa drug in a living animal include blood flow to tissues, lipid solubility, regional differences in pH, the degree ofbinding to extracellular substances and intracellular uptake. Following slaughter, different mechanisms affect the drug redistribution process. Pounder and Jones (1990) noted that these included the depletion of energy-dependent processes which might concentrate the drug in specific tissues, cell death, changes in drug-binding proteins, changes in the permeability of intertissue barriers after death, postmortem changes in pH, and the ionic strength of intraand extracellular fluids which allowed the drug to redistribute down concentration gradients. Furthermore, Richardson (2000) reported that postmortem catabolism of unstable drugs also occurred and the twin processes of redistribution (which might increase drug concentrations) and degradation (which decreases drug concentrations), might occur together and at different rates. In veterinary medicine, the redistribution of a drug postmortem is expected to be different from the human situation, as animals are exsanguinated following slaughter. The aim of this study was to obtain scientific data on which to base recommendations for the choice of muscle tissue sites for residue studies used to determine withdrawal periods and residue monitoring. Three four-month-old calves with a mean bodyweight of 88 kg were administered 10 mg/kg tilmicosin (Micotil; Elanco) subcutaneously in the neck. The animals had received no medication in the previous three weeks and were maintained outdoors on grass. They were slaughtered by stunning 72 hours after treatment and exsanguinated. Muscle tissue (50 to 200 g samples) from the external masseter, tongue, shoulder (supraspinatus), heart (whole organ), diaphragm, loin (longissimus) and gluteal muscle (gluteobiceps) were collected within six hours of slaughter, into prelabelled, polythene sample bags and stored at -20\u00b0C before analysis. Three to six subsamples were taken by slicing the frozen tissue samples with a scalpel into thin pieces while still chilled and firm. Extraction of the tilmicosin marker residue (parent compound) from incurred muscle and from fortified muscle involved placing 3-3 g muscle samples into 25 ml plastic glass universal containers and adding 6-7 ml of acetonitrile to each. The samples were blended using a blender (Polytron) for approximately 20 seconds until the tissue pellet was fully homogenised. The blender was cleaned between samples to avoid cross-contamination. The glass universals containing the tissue samples were capped and stored either in a fridge overnight or in a freezer for 20 minutes before being centrifuged at 850 gand 0\u00b0C for five minutes. The supernatants were taken off using a pipette into 2 ml conical, plastic millifuge vials and centrifuged again at 1 1,500gat room temperature for two minutes. Approximately 250 Fi ofthis clear supernatant was transferred by pipette to the glass inserts in high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) vials for analysis. Six fortified samples over the concentration range 0 to 3000 ng/g were used for assay validation, with the fortification taking place following homogenisation with the extractant. A fortified set of standards, including an untreated (negative) control sample of muscle tissue, was prepared and run with each set of treated samples, and the data generated were used to calibrate a dose-response curve from which the unknown samples were read. The HPLC assay was an isocratic system using a mobile phase comprising acetonitrile, methanol and phosphate buffer (ratio 6:6:8) at pH 5-8 with a uv detector (287 nm). This assay was used to measure residual concentrations of tilmicosin which displayed typical chromatographic retention times of 6-6 minutes. Using this method, mean accuracies of 94 to 98 per cent were achieved over four separate days (interday accuracy). The method displayed good linearity (r2=0-997 to 0-999) and recovery (99 to 110 per cent). The mean intra-assay coefficient of variations (cvs) based on four repeated analyses within one day was 1-3 per cent, and the mean interassay cv was 3-4 per cent. The limit of quantification was 130 ng/g. All unknown and fortified samples were analysed in duplicate. The mean result of each duplicate analysis was used for the calculation of drug concentrations. Each subsample was recorded as a separate data point in the results section. The variations in the concentrations found within a muscle sample (that is, concentrations in the subsamples) were expressed as the intrasite cv percentage. All sample concentrations fell within the validated range of the assay. The data show that residues were not evenly distributed within the muscle samples, as outlined in Table 1. Residues in the heart muscle were always below the limit of quantification of the method. The magnitude of the variation in muscle concentrations of drug residues has been shown to be outside that associated with the conduct of the analysis, as shown by the relatively higher cv values for the intrasite analysis compared with the cvs from the precision and reproducibility of the assay. Williams and Pounder (1997) stated that cv values greater than 10 were indicative of a non-homogenous distribution. The results of these studies have implications for residue surveillance and residue depletion studies used for establishing withdrawal periods for veterinary medicines, including the following: as residue concentrations in individual muscle masses were in the same order of magnitude (apart from heart muscle), surveillance of drug residues of tilmicosin could be targeted at one specific muscle, for example, the diaphragm; applicant companies conducting residue studies for regulatory purposes should include muscle tissue from several locations within the animal and homogenise them before analysis. The locations chosen should be identified in any trial protocol or test report.

Hence it is necessary to ensure that policies aimed at reducing greenhouse gases from agriculture do not impose inappropriate and unacceptable costs to the industry. The major challenge for the agriculture sector is to identify where these major sources originate within the production system and to develop processes and technologies that lead to their abatement. Estimating emissions from agriculture is a difficult task and current estimates have a large margin of uncertainty due to the paucity of data available from soil and animal sources, and the inherent variability of biological systems. Estimates of agriculture's contribution to greenhouse emissions have been made using very generalised data inputs from a few isolated experiments. On this basis the estimated contribution of greenhouse gases from the agriculture sector is quite substantial to the national audits for both Australia and New Zealand. For example, it is estimated that about one third of Australia's total emissions and about half of New Zealand's total emissions are derived from the land sector.

Davies has brought the Black Sea steppe back into the mainstream of history writing on early modern Europe. In this fluently written and deeply researched study, Davies examines the strategic, operational, and social dimensions of warfare along the northern coasts of the Black Sea from the early sixteenth century through the campaigns of Peter the Great. Davies's book is less self-consciously conceptual than William McNeill's classic Europe's Steppe Frontier (1964) nor does it attempt the daring interpretations offered by Mikhail Khodarkovsky's Russia's Steppe Frontier (2002). But Davies's finely crafted book brings to life an era of interstate conflict, slavetrading, frontier-crossing, and early empire-building that has often fallen victim to the nationalist historiographies of eastern and central Europe. One gleans from it a sense of the western steppe as a genuine place in its own right, not an empty \"wild field\" occasionally traversed by Tatar-Mongol horsemen or Polish-Lithuanian infantry. It challenges historians to imagine the region not as a frontier\u2014now something of a cliche\u2014but rather as a zone of intense cultural interactions, where the people living in cities, towns, villages, and encampments became experts in the art of navigating multiple political, economic, and military environments. Davies is particularly good on the mechanics of warfare. Two finely drawn maps illustrate the defensive lines erected by Muscovy to discourage Tatar raids, as well as the well-worn routes through Moldova, Podolia, and Zaporozhia followed by both Tatar raiders and, in earlier and later periods, Italian, Slavic, and Jewish traders and cattle-drovers. Ambitious sons of Polish-Lithuanian magnates went to war arrayed in leopardskin pelisses, with enormous, feather-encrusted wings sprouting from their backplates. Ottoman and Tatar cavalry attacks challenged Muscovites to develop better stationary defenses for military outposts. Don Cossacks provided usable but inconstant partners to Muscovite armies by adapting the fighting techniques of their Tatar neighbors. The grand themes of Davies's volume are the twin military-political imperatives of patron-seeking and client-making. Over the two centuries surveyed here, the steppe zone became the object of rival states and empires, none of which had sufficient economic or military power to claim it fully as their own. Local elites sold their services to distant and willing patrons, who provided tribute or privileged trading relationships. In time, however, empires sought to recast these relations as imperial hierarchies, picking some local notables over others and transforming them into bearers of the imperial imprimatur. Both processes were always fraught, however. For the Ottomans, the khans of Crimea and the other beys of the northern littoral were a useful brake on Polish-Lithuanian and Muscovite ambitions, yet their slave-raiding continually threatened to drag the Ottomans into new and undesirable wars. The Don and Zaporozhian Cossacks served a similar purpose for Lithuanians and Muscovites, yet their actions could disrupt advantageous trade networks that crossed both steppe and sea. In the transition from principalities, khanates, beyliks, hordes, and kingdoms toward modern empires, warfare was a constant feature of social life, as annual campaigning seasons provided both income for and threats to local societies. In clear prose and with an expert eye for the telling detail, Davies shows how strategy, trade, and military innovation interacted to transform the Black Sea hinterlands.", "year": 2010, "openAccessPdf": null, "authors": [{"authorId": "145668638", "name": "C.

Stark\u2019s G\u00f6ttliche Kinder is a lightly reworked dissertation. As the title indicates, it investigates the images of divine children, both gods and children of gods. The first chapter, an introduction, gives a good review of the scholarship, demonstrating why this book claims to be the first study to consider all the divine children known to have been depicted in Greek art. The questions the author asks of the material and the methodology that she employs\u2014a traditional iconographic approach using both ancient literature and art\u2014are presented. The second chapter is made up of eight sections, each of which is devoted to one of the gods or heroes. Apollo is first. He is shown as a child only in connection with the slaying of Python. Usually he has his bow and arrow, and he is held by his mother, Leto. One vase shows him already grown, so that the artistic renderings of the scenes, like the literary sources, vary as to what age Apollo was when he slew Python: a child or a young man. One lost red-figure vase, which is known only from a drawing (and is possibly not authentic), may show Leto\u2014holding both the child Apollo and his twin sister, Artemis\u2014as she flees from Python, a version of the story not given in the literary sources. Hermes is discussed next, and only two rarely depicted moments from his childhood are shown: his theft of Apollo\u2019s cattle shortly after his birth, and Iris caring for him as a young boy. What story was connected with the latter is unknown. All but one of the vases, a Caeretan hydria, is red-figure. No depiction of Zeus as a child survives. Although statues and reliefs showing a young Zeus are known from Pausanias, the pieces themselves are lost. There are, however, two Attic red-figure vases that show Rhea carrying a draped, childlike figure, which is really a draped stone meant to fool Chronos into thinking that he will be swallowing his infant son Zeus. The god exhibiting the most complicated childhood in the literary sources and displaying the most variety in the visual record is Dionysos. Forty-one (and possibly six other) vases, 19 pieces of sculpture, and two coins show him as a child. The moments represented include his being born from Semele or Zeus, his being handed over by Zeus or Hermes to the nymphs of Nysa or Paposilenus, and Hermes entrusting the child to Athamas and Ino; in addition, the child god is shown in the care of Zeus, the nymphs, a Silen, or Hermes.

Since what is possible for sheep has also proven possible for other large animals, there have been intense debates on the ethical and legal issues related to the prospect of cloning humans. This review focuses on how cloning is accomplished in mammals and the variety of possible applications of cloning, with an emphasis on uses related to human health. WHY DOLLYMANIA? Dolly caused such a fuss because she was a fully developed animal cloned from a body cell of an adult mammal. There were lambs, Megan and Morag, cloned a year before Dolly, but they came from embryonic cells (Campbell et al., I996) and created nothing akin to the worldwide \"Dollymania\" that arose after announcement of Dolly's birth by scientists at the Roslin Institute in Edinburgh, Scotland, and their colleagues at the related biopharmaceutical company, PPL. Dolly was not just a mammal like usshe came from an adult cell (Wilmut et al.,1997). Dolly told us that it is probably possible to clone anyone, including a human, regardless of age, even if the person is dead-as long as a living cell can be found. Scientists and laypeople alike were unsettled. Scientists were unsettled because they had long thought that earlier cloning successes were related to the unusual regenerative capacity of amphibian and embryonic cells. The birth of Dolly turned this notion upside down and opened a whole new area of scientific research with important new applications for the benefit of humankind. However, laypeople and scientists alike also were unsettled because the issues related to mammalian cloning, especially human cloning, had not been carefully thought out, and there were essentially no guidelines. The following pages provide a brief introduction of the technology of cloning and an overview of its potential applications in science and medicine. HOW TO CLONE AN ANIMAL Cloning Megan, Morag, and then Dolly was accomplished by \"nuclear transfer,\" a technique similar to that used in cloning tadpoles in the 1970s. Nuclear transfer can be summarized in a sentence: Insert a donor cell or its genetic material into an unfertilized egg (oocyte) from which the genetic material has been removed, activate it, then place the \"reconstructed embryo\" into a surrogate mother for development to term. However, the procedure is actually a complex one that is confounded by the idiosyncrasies of reproduction in different species. Dolly's birth is a tribute to a long line of biologists who have been studying the details of embryonic development for a century and exploring cloning for nearly half of that time. The essential elements of the nuclear transfer technique developed and successfully employed by Ian Wilmut, Keith Campbell, and their colleagues (Wilmut et al., i997; Campbell et al.,1996) are illustrated in Figure r. The figure legend provides some additional detail related to individual steps, and slight variations on this method have been described, but the basic technique has now been used to clone a variety of different mammalian species, including mice (Wakayama et al., 1998), goats (Baguisi et al., 1999), and cattle (Kubota et al., 2000). The original experiment in sheep was relatively inefficient. Dolly was a 1-in-277 success story: Of 277 reconstructed oocytes, 29 embryos apparently developed properly, but only one (approximately 3 percent of transferred embryos) led to a live birth. However, the procedure in other species such as mice and cows is more efficient, with approximately 20 to 30 percent of reconstructed embryos developing to live animals (Wakayama et al., 1998; Kubota et al., 2000). This frequency of success is not much different from that for in vitro fertilization of oocytes with sperm or conventional mating. \u2026", "year": 2000, "openAccessPdf": null, "authors": [{"authorId": "3352995", "name": "C.

Peningkatan NKT melalui perbaikan manajemen dan suplementasi probiotik BIOPLUS pada induk BX diharapkan akan meningkatkan kualitas calon induk resipien transfer embrio kembar. Dua puluh ekor induk BX yang ada di Desa Sidomulyo, Kecamatan Banyuasin I Kabupaten Banyuasin diidentifikasi sistem produksi, NKT dan organ reproduksinya. Perlakuan perbaikan manajemen produksi dan suplementasi probiotik BIOPLUS dilaksanakan selama 2 bulan. Hasil penelitian menunjukkan bahwa hanya 13 dari 20 induk BX yang memenuhi persyaratan sebagai calon resipien transfer embrio kembar dengan rataan NKT 3-4, siklus berahi 21- 24 hari dan perbaikan pada kesehatan organ reproduksi.Keywords: BX cow, twinning cattle, embryo transfer, probiotic.", "year": 2019, "openAccessPdf": {"url": "http://ejurnal.bppt.go.id/index.php/JSTI/article/download/3422/2846", "status": "BRONZE"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "146063236", "name": "Armina Fariani"}, {"authorId": "87958311", "name": "L.

In the era of genomics, a large number of animals is being genotyped with high throughput genotyping methods, which are giving limited insight into the performance of single markers and rather only statistical description of the results is available for a common user. This hampers the detailed analysis of the results obtained and direct identification of the causes of poorer performance of some samples. In this study we describe the influence of analysis of DNA obtained from blood samples of cattle with genetic chimerism on basic parameters of Infinium technology-based Illumina\u2019s genotyping arrays.

Autosomal Trisomy in a Malformed Newborn Calf*)", "abstract": "Autosomal abnormality in cattle was first reported in three cases of lymphatic leukemia showing that aneuploidy was resulted from a centric chromosome fusion or translocation of the Robertsonian type (Gustavsson and Rockborn, 1964). Chromosomal anomalies of a similar nature were found in a set of bovine triplets by Herschler and Fechheimer (1966) and in more than one hundred cattle out of 1134 by Gustavsson (1966). The latter author regarded that the chromosome abnormality reported by him is a case of intraspecific chromosomal polymorphism. Autosomal aberrations of a similar character were also found to occur in two domestic dogs, one with congenital cardiac defects (Shive et al., 1965), and the other with bone chondroplasia (Hare et al., 1967), and in European wild pigs (McFee et al., 1966). Aside from those translocation carriers extra autosomes have been reported in a bovine anidian twin monster (Dunn et al., 1967), in a calf with cryptorchism (Hoffmann, 1967) and in a calf with the malformed lower jaw (Herzog and Hohn, 1968) which was noted as autosomal trisomy. The present communication deals with a case of presumably autosomal trisomy in a malformed newborn calf carrying several phenotypic anomalies. Case notes. A 4-year-old registered Holstein Friesian cow, which had previously given birth to a normal female calf, delivered a malformed male calf after 293 days of gestation, seven to ten days longer than normal. The calf was a live-born male with the following clinical features : severe growth retardation (birth weight 11 kg, crown-rump length 55 cm), arched vertebral column, shortening of the lower jaw (3 cm shorter than upper one), irregular arrangement of the incisors, ankylosis of the right hind-leg, cryptorchism, apparently normal penis and scrotum and slight outside-bending of", "year": 2006, "openAccessPdf": null, "authors": [{"authorId": "2168233881", "name": "By Michiko"}, {"authorId": "2167071405", "name": "Motomichi"}, {"authorId": "2167004366", "name": "Sasaki"}, {"authorId": "2002329404", "name": "Tsune"}, {"authorId": "1943980367", "name": "Ishikawa"}, {"authorId": "75115828", "name": "Keiichiro"}, {"authorId": "122083458", "name": "Kawata"}]}

Cattle usually produce only one calf per gestation resulting from ovulation of a single follicle. The most common form of twinning in cattle occurs due to multiple ovulations which may produce dizygotic twins. The twin births in dairy cattle often negatively impacts the reproduction, production, health and reduces the productive lifespan of cows. Therefore, there is a great interest to know the multiple ovulations and multiple births to reduce the twinning rate in dairy cattle herds. \nObjective: This review updates the status of multiple births and its impact and consequences on production of dairy cattle and goats.\nMaterials and Methods: The related literatures on the multiple births in cattle and goats have been reviewed for which the search was carried out in Google Scholar, PubMed, CrossRef, Banglajol and also the online daily newspapers. \nResults: Although multiple births with up to quadruplets have been reported from different countries, the prevalence of twin births are commonly reported in dairy cattle. The prevalence of twinning rates are varied widely in different breeds like twin calving in Holstein Friesian cattle is 3 to 5%, 5.6% Spanish dairy herd and 3.9% in Iranian Holsteins, whereas triplet and quadruplet births represent 0.015% and 0.004% of the total births, respectively. Twin calving shorten gestation length, increased dystocia, stillbirths, decrease birth weight, perinatal calf mortality, retained placenta, decrease milk production, increases the occurrence of metabolic diseases, reduced conception rate, increased calving interval, shorten the productive lifespan of the dam and increases overall culling rate. Two strategies- the transfer of a single embryo produced in vitro and follicular drainage of co-dominant follicles at AI have been suggested to prevent twin pregnancies.\nConclusion: Multiple births in dairy cattle is not desirable due to negative effects on both cows that calve twins and calves born as twins that result in economic losses in dairy herds. Regardless of the direct effect of multiple births on health and fertility, reducing the occurrence of multiple ovulations to decrease the risk of twin births is desirable to mitigate the negative consequences of twinning in dairy cattle. The estimated losses due to twinning range between US$ 59 to 161 per twin pregnancy and attempting manual embryo reduction decreased the economic losses of a twin pregnancy by US $ 23 to 45. Bangladesh scientists discovered a new technique to produce twin calves but the future research on this aspect need to consider the negative effects of twin births in cattle.", "year": 2022, "openAccessPdf": null, "authors": [{"authorId": "98137388", "name": "M.

The bull, brought to Ruakura for study, was mated to a number of identical twin (predominantly Jersey) cows over two years. Of 61 resulting calves 52 per cent. were born with defective eyes, being partially or completely blind. The incidence of the abnormality appeared independent of sex or of genotype of the dam, the findings being compatible with simple autos,qmal dominant inheritance. A current gene mutation was inferred from the absence of any history of the defect in the pedigree of the bull, who himself had shown the fault at an early age. Clinical manifestations varied from total cataract through partial cataract or cloudy cornea to complete cornea1 opacity accompanied by enlargement of the eye. Post-mortem examination revealed lens abnormality in both eyes of all affected calves. The lens, opaque in all cases, was frequently displaced and evidenced partial or complete disintegration and absorption, apparently following initial rupture of\u2019 the posterior capsule. Other effects noted included dilatation of the pupil, internal haemorrhage with some fibrin formation and umbrella-like detachment of the retina (includin, 0 one eye of the bull). Post-mortem eye measurements indicated general enlargement of the eyeball, most extreme with complete cornea1 opacity. Some variation in expression of the characteristic was noted both between eyes in the same individual and between full sibs. In some cases total cataract at birth gave way to partial blindness only following disintegration or displacement of the lens. The condition is appropriately defined as developmental cataract, lentitular opacity being presumed the primary effect. It is semilethal in character, surviving animals having either no lens or a non-functional lens residue, with consequent impaired vision. The case is of interest in showing dominant inheritance as opposed to most reported sublethal characters, including hereditary cataract, in cattle.", "year": 1960, "openAccessPdf": null, "authors": [{"authorId": "29989267", "name": "A.

However, a small number of these CRD\u2019s have failed to give a reliable estimate of faecal chromium concentration. In this paper we examine the factors associated with discarded or non usable estimates (non estimate) obtained in intake studies conducted as part of a Meat Research Corporation-funded twinning project at Grafton, New South Wales. Between 1991 and 1993, 697 CRD\u2019s (of the second type, released in 1991 by Captec) were used on a herd of 180 Angus x Hereford cows to estimate faecal output. These cows had liveweight ranging from 394-712 kg and were carrying, or rearing, either single or twin calves. The cows grazed a summer pasture of kikuyu grass, paspalum, Rhodes grass and couch grass with an estimated digestibility from 65-750/c, and a winter pasture of irrigated ryegrass with a digestibility from 75-85%. An experienced operator was used to dose the cows with the CRD\u2019s. Only 7 CRD\u2019s were regurgitated at or shortly after dosing; these were successfully redosed. Estimates were made at late pregnancy, early, mid and late lactation, from cows at stocking rates ranging from 1.9-3.8 cows/ha. There were 66 non estimates (9.4%) from the 697 CRD\u2019s. Forty of these CRD\u2019s were recovered from the pasture within 2-l 0 days of dosin, 0 and the cows from which the CRD\u2019s came had little detectable faecal Cr. Of the other 26 non estimates 6 gave high faecal Cr on day 7 of faeces sampling and low readings subsequently. This pattern suggests there was damage to the CRD. The 66 non estimates were confined to 19 cows. Eight of the cows (dosed 3 or more times) failed to retain 50% of the CRD\u2019s, indicating that particular cows were at fault. A preliminary analysis of the factors including COW liveweight, physiological stage, rearing a single or twin calf, stocking rate, pasture digestibility and dosing order did not indicate a significant effect on CRD failure; further analyses, using a logistic regression of the factors, are in progress. However\u2019 there were certain trends. Cows rearing twin calves and which gave non estimates were heavier (mean liveweight k s.e.) than cows providing a usable estimate (573 v 549 * 44.0 kg). The proportion of non estimates was also higher in cows in early compared to late lactation, or during pregnancy (Table l), which was possibly a consequence of a higher intake associated with early lactation (D.W.

The effects of castration and/or implantation on muscle distribution, fat partition and carcass value were assessed by comparison with the untreated (control) bull values within each group and expressed as a ratio (treatedxontrol). These ratios were then compared between groups. Implantation of steers increased slightly the weight of muscles in the neck which in a preliminary study had been shown to be particularly heavy in mature bulls compared with steers. Implantation therefore produced a more bull-like muscle distribution in steers and the effect in bulls was to increase the weight of these muscles even further. In steers and bulls the partition of body fat was not affected by implantation. Both implanted steers and bulls were fatter than their respective control bulls and their fat partition was appropriate to this (higher subcutaneous to intermuscular fat ratio). Differences in carcass value between the groups, as evidenced by a retail cutting method applied to the right side of the carcass, reflected these differences in muscle distribution and fat partition. Thus, implantation of steers was judged to be economically advantageous despite the marginal reduction in value brought about by enlarged forequarter musculature. Implanted bull carcasses were less valuable than their respective controls mainly because they were fatter and required more trimming.", "year": 1986, "openAccessPdf": null, "authors": [{"authorId": "2234404483", "name": "J.

Abortion in equine may be infectious or non-infectious. Infectious agents such as bacteria, viruses or fungi may attack the fetus or its membranes, resulting in fetal\n death and its expulsion. Non-infectious agents such as development of twins, torsion of umbilical cord or congenital anomalies may also result in death of the fetus and abortion (Kocabiyik et al., 2005). Many causes of late-term abortion including\n infectious agents and placental abnormalities have been reported. Sometimes thorough post-abortion and post-delivery examination of the fetus, placenta and umbilical cord may reveal other causes that are not identified with laboratory procedures.\n Retention of placenta is probably less common in equine because of simple, diffuse type of placentation and the strong uterine contractions aiding the separation of the villi from their maternal crypts and expelling the detached membranes (Roberts,\n 2004). Fetal membranes were defined as retained if they were not expelled completely within three hours after delivery in equine and has been regarded as a threat to the uterine health and general health of the equine. The reported sequelae of\n retained fetal membranes range from none to metritis, laminitis, septicemia and death (Provencher et al., 1988).

The objectives were to identify factors associated with the RT of postpartum dairy cows and provide descriptive statistics of the RT during the first 10 DIM to clarify the normal range of RT for cows. Daily RT was evaluated from 1 to 10 DIM for all cows calving during 2 consecutive summers on a single 1,500-cow Holstein dairy. Cows were placed into metabolic/digestive (METB), infectious (INF), and no recorded disease (NONE) groups based on disease diagnoses during the first 10 DIM. Cows were grouped based on calving difficulty and parity. Multiple linear regression models with repeated measures were used to evaluate the factors associated with RT. Three hundred and ninety-two cows were evaluated, of which 45% were primiparous and 32% required assistance at calving. No difference was observed in calving assistance by parity. First disease diagnoses peaked in the INF and METB groups at 3 and 1 DIM, respectively.

On Day 8, the DIP was removed and cows received an IM injection of 150\u2009\u03bcg of cloprostenol (Veteglan\u00ae, Hertape Calier, Juatuba, MG, Brazil). At this time, the animals were randomly distributed into 3 groups.

Oestrus observation was performed daily from the time of the withdrawal of the DIP until the day of FTAI. Ovaries were examined ultrasonically at the time of FTAI, the following day and 7 days after FTAI. Pregnancy diagnosis was done by ultrasonography 30 days after FTAI and the incidence of twin or single calves was recorded at birth. Data were analysed by chi-square test. The rate of expression of oestrus was 70.0% (group 1), 82.9% (group 2), and 78.2% (group 3; P\u2009=\u20090.25). Cows that had 2 or more large follicles at the time of FTAI was 0% (group 1), 14.6% (group 2), and 34.8% (group 3; P\u2009<\u20090.05). The ovulation rate of cows in group 1 (80.0%) was higher than cows in groups 2 (48.8%) and 3 (52.2%; P\u2009<\u20090.05). The conception rates for groups 1, 2, and 3 were 50.0, 26.8, and 39.1%, respectively (P\u2009<\u20090.05).

DESIGN--The study was an analysis of malformation rates in singleton and twin births using data from the Office of Population Censuses and Survey's Congenital Malformation Notification Scheme. SETTING--This was a national survey of births in England and Wales in 1979-1980 and 1982-1985. PARTICIPANTS--The data comprised 95,510 reported malformations in 3.7 million singleton births, and 1925 reported malformations in 76,000 twin births. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS--Twin malformation ratios were calculated using maternal age specific singleton rates as standard. In comparison with singleton births, twins have significantly higher reported frequencies of indeterminate sex and pseudohermaphroditism; anencephaly; patent ductus arteriosis; exomphalos; hydrocephalus; anomalies of the umbilical vessels; atresia or stenosis of the large intestine or anus; and tracheo-oesophageal fistula, atresia or stenosis. Twins also have significant reported deficits of polydactyly and syndactyly; congenital dislocation of the hip; anomalies of the tongue, branchial cleft and auricular sinus; post-anal dimple; and Down's syndrome. CONCLUSIONS--Several major malformations were significantly more common in twins than in singletons. The excess of indeterminate sex and pseudohermaphroditism has not been described before and may be analogous to freemartinism in cattle. Most of the conditions less common in twins are minor, and the reported deficits may be due to underascertainment of the less serious conditions in twins.

Deer share their ranges with few other ungulates, whereas impala may share their ground with as many as 16 other species of ungulates. Impala were found to have a clearly marked breeding season with the young born during a brief period in the early part of the wet season. Ewes produce their first young at two years of age. No evidence of twinning was observed. The rut occurs early in the dry season, and at this time territorial behavior is in evidence. Age classes of impala were determined by tooth replacement and wear. Yearlings were found to comprise about 25% of the population. A shortage of young adults was noted, and a high percentage of older animals was found in the population. Females predominate among the adults, which may be explained by differential sex mortality among lambs. Data on movements suggest that impala herds occupy relatively small home ranges where the distribution of food, cover and water permits. In the absence of one of these factors, impala will move a considerable distance to obtain it. In one area movements of at least 15 miles to and from water during the dry season were observed.

The films were crosslinked by glutaraldehyde to reduce solubility in water at 60\u00b0C, the swelling and to increase stability against enzymatic attack. The combination of rheological characterisation and DSC investigation showed, that the material behaved as an interpenetrating network of covalently crosslinked gel and physical gel, stabilized by hydrogen bonds. Introduction Thermoplastic processing is an elegant and widely used technology to form polymer melts into films, tubes, profiles, to blend polymers with additives and fillers and to foam polymer melts. Not only synthetic polymers but also a couple of biopolymers have already been treated by thermoplastic processing. In case of biopolymers the process is often called extrusion cooking, because it has to be performed with water contents from 15 up to 80% and at temperatures around 80 up to 150\u00b0C. Thermoplastic processing has several advantages over other polymer treatment technologies. Extrusion as one of the most popular processes is a continuous technology performed mostly free from organic solvents as one step technology. Extrusion cooking is used in food industry inter alia to manufacture ready-to-eat cereals, pasta and to texturize and form doughs [1]. Untanned collagen containing by-products are fleshings, trimmings and splits. Fleshings are separated in their fat and collagen component to manufacture gelatine and hydrolysates from the collageneous part. Because of the low gelatine quality, they are also disposed by making biogas. Trimmings are used to make gelatine and splits can be processed to gelatine, casings or higher quality products as sponges for the cosmetic industry. The known industrial processes of collagen treatment comprise the use as solution or paste. Both are dissolved in neutral or acidic aqueous solvents and then cast or formed and dried. Casings for sausages are extruded, but this extrusion is performed at about 10\u00b0C from a raw stock, that contains about 85% of water. Therefore, the collagen is processed under nondenaturating conditions, so that fibres and triple helices remain stable [2]. In contrast, we have shown, that dry collagen powder, which was produced from dried splits, defatted fleshings and trimmings, could be treated by thermoplastic processing to form films, tubes and coatings. The aim of our present work is to show the potential of thermoplastic processing of collagen and the properties of the resulting extrudates [3][4][5]. Technological aspects Preparation of raw material Limed (unhaired) cattle hides were split, extensively washed and air-dried. The water content was adjusted in the range of 10% to 15%; pH laid between 8 and 9. This parchment like material (dried pelt) was ground into a fine powder. Mixing In earlier investigations it was found that widely insoluble collagen of pelts could be transferred into water-soluble partial hydrolysates by thermo-mechanical treatment in an internal mixer. During this thermo-mechanical treatment the fibrous structure of collagen disappeared. Besides other parameters like pH and temperature the degree of solubility depended strongly on the input of mechanical energy Espec. This specific energy input was calculated to be up to Espec=14.4 MJ/kg, when treated over 30 min in the mixer [3]. The hydrolysates were able to form stiff gels, when a warm aqueous solution was cooled down. Obviously, the increase of solubility showed that the molecular weight was being decreased and covalent bonds were cleaved. In contrast to gelatine manufacture the thermomechanical treatment did not lead to topochemical hydrolysis as it is observed during gelatine production [6]. Extrusion and film calendering To extrude the material, the humidity of the collagen powder was adjusted up to 50% water content. Furthermore glycerol was added up to 40% per dry matter as plasticising agent. This powder was molten on an extruder, which was equipped with a band die. The strong band of 2 mm thickness was calendered into a thin film of ~150\u03bcm on a Collin roller. The mechanical energy, which was brought into the material by extrusion, was calculated according to m 01 , 0 M n/n 2 E max spec & \u22c5 \u22c5 \u22c5 = where n ... rpm of the screws nmax ... maximum rpm M ... torque m& ... specific throughput (kg/h) Under stable extrusion conditions the throughput reached 3,6 kg/h. This led to the specific mechanical energy input Espec=0,5 MJ/kg into the material. Therefore, only seven percent of the energy was brought into the material by the used extruder, compared to the specific energy of the soluble material treated in the internal mixer. The extruded material was not soluble in water (60\u00b0C) after extrusion, but it melted during the process and seemed to behave thermoplastic. Characterisation Solubility and Swelling The solubility in water at 60\u00b0C (2h) and the swelling were measured from calendered films with and without cross-linking by glutaraldehyde (GA). Fig. 2a shows, that the solubility of the non cross-linked films laid around 25%, whereas it decreased strongly down to less than 1% when soaked in solutions of 0,1%...1% GA. The swelling of film samples was also reduced depending on the crosslinking time and the concentration of GA from 500% down to 250% (Fig 2b). The swollen samples (bands, films) looked transparent and felt rubber to gellike.

Embryo transfer following artificial insemination (AI) improves pregnancy rate by replenishing interferon tau (IFNT), but it results in a notably higher rate of twin occurrence. This study hypothesized that parthenogenetic (PA) embryo transfer following AI (AI + PA) could improve the conception rate because that PA embryo become as a supplemental source of IFNT without twins. PA embryos showed higher IFNT mRNA expression than in vitro fertilization (IVF) embryos. An examination of the effect of the cultured conditioned media (CM) of PA or IVF embryos on Madin-Darby bovine kidney cells with stably introduced promoter-reporter constructs of interferon-stimulated gene 15 (ISG15, marker of IFN response) showed higher stimulation levels of ISG15 promoter activity with PA than with IVF embryo. We investigated in vivo the effect of AI + PA on healthy Japanese Black cattle. Cattle transferred with PA embryo alone were non-fertile, but those that underwent AI + PA showed a pregnancy rate of 53.3%, the similar as that with AI alone (60%). In pregnant cattle in AI + PA group, adding the PA embryo upregulated the expression of ISGs and plasma progesterone concentration. No twin were generated in AI only and AI + PA groups. Using repeat breeding Holstein cows that did not become pregnant with 4\u20139 times of AI, transfer of PA embryo following AI resulted in a higher pregnancy rate than that of control (AI only).

These include lower calf survival, increased dystocia (malpresentation), increased stillbirth, increased abortion, calf abandonment, retained placenta, lengthened interval from parturition to conception and freemartin heifers when born co-twin with a male. Some of these problems can be overcome with changes in management, others lack an obvious managment fix and still others are of little practical significance. Management alterations which may be required for successful exploitation of twin birth include (1) pregnancy checks to determine twin versus single pregnancy, (2) adequate calving facilities and (3) early calf weaning. Determining whether a cow is pregnant with twins elminates surprises at calving time in that cows at high risk for malpresentation are identified beforehand. In addition, cows gestating twins could be fed a higher plane of nutrition in recognition of the higher demands on them both during late gestation and subsequently while nursing twins. Adequate calving facilites are a necessity given the significant fraction of twin births which are malpresentations. Additionally, availability of calving pens facilities penning of cows with their twins which is sometimes needed to address potential calf abandonment problems. Early weaning is well documented to have beneficial effects on postpartum reproductive performance. Given the typically longer interval from par-turition to conception for twin bearing cows, early calf weaning may help maintain adequate reproductive performance. Considering the remaining problems, there are no obvious alterations of management which will improve twinning-related problems with stillbirth, abortion or retained placenta. Freemartinism falls into the last category of something which is more a percieved than real problem. Given that absolute number of fertile females produced from a twinning system will differ little from a single-birth system, freemartinism is not a serious drawback of twinning in beef cattle. 864 Comparison of the profitability of single-calf with twinning cow herds. herds on 202 hectares (500 acres) of moderately productive forage land with three levels of twinning (1%, 50%, 90%) with or without 2 kg supplement ($0.12/kg) for 90 days in early lactation expected to maintain fertility in cows with twins to the same level as cows with singles.

In this case this feature is substantiated by the non-reactivity of one twin to the other in the mixed lymphocyte culture system, and one would expect a skin or organ transplant between the two to survive as well as in the monozygotic twin situation. The difficulty in this particular case is the sexing of the twins. Physically they appear normal male and female children, apart from the undescended testes in the boy, and the sexes are confirmed by buccal smear examination. To date there is no evidence of the embryonic male or female hormones having any effect on the opposite sexed twin in the chimeric situation, and the majority of chimeric twins so far reported have proved to be fertile. However, in cattle, Lillie (1916) suggested that vascular anastomoses in unlike sexed bovine twins were the cause of the free-martin condition, caused by exchange of embryonal hormones affecting the normal sexual development of the female twin. If this were so in this case, and hormonal exchange does take place across the anastomoses, it would be difficult to explain why one twin had hypothyroidism and the other twin was euthyroidic. The answer to this query will have to wait until either PK's testes descend of their own accord, or with surgical assistance.", "year": null, "openAccessPdf": null, "authors": []}

Criteria used for selecting markers were number of alleles, ease of scoring, and relative position within linkage group. Markers were multiplexed or multiple-loaded on the gels to reduce the costs and labor required to obtain genotypic data. This approach reduced the number of gels by 45% when compared with running each marker independently. Male animals selected for the genomic scan sired the majority of the population. A modified interval analysis was used in a granddaughter design to compare effects of each allele within sire for 10 different sire families. The midparent deviation of the son's estimated breeding value for ovulation rate was used as the phenotype. Forty-one potential peaks were identified with a nominal significance level < or = 0.05. The 10 peaks with the highest significance levels (P < 0.02) were selected for further analysis. Markers were genotyped across daughters of the sire where nominal significance was found for each of the 10 peaks. One peak (BTA5, relative position 40 cM) was found to be nominally significant in the daughters. The nominal significance levels were P = 0.01 for the sons (n = 32) and P = 0.02 for the daughters (n = 94) of sire 784403. A combined genomewide significance value (P = 0.07) was calculated that accounted for the 10 analyses with sons and the 10 analyses with daughters.

In conjunction with these studies, we have acquired sufficient data to define a major histocompatibility locus in cattle using alloimmune anti-lymphocyte typing sera as well as the mixed lymphocyte culture technic.

Conversion of 400 hectares, 600 breeding ewes (in 3 flocks) and 5 suckler cows was completed in 1993. The current evaluation (1995-1998) took place under full organic production. The assessmet is based on comparing organic and conventioanl farming systems, supported by data collected from commercial organic farms linked to the main project, and a number of replicated experiments. \n \nGrassland management on the Unit integrates three distinct types of grazing; inbye fields (3%), improved hill (17%) and unimproved native hill (80%) for sheep and cattle production. Native hill receives no inputs under organic or conventional management, so that potential differences in output are very much reduced. Low levels of fertiliser and pesticide inputs are made to conventionally managed imroved hill land, with only small differnces in output ad livestock performance. The largest potential differences occur on the more productive inbye land, which receive a high level of inputs conventially. Relying mainly on clover organically managed swards, have been able to achieve 80%, or more, of the forage output from conventional swards receiving over 200 kg N ha-1. Newcastle University undertook an assessment of botanical composition on native hill, improved native and improved hill few changes have been detected, mainly due to the maintenance of comparable stocking rates on the organic and conventional systems. However in one flock, where stocking rate was reduced by 25% there were some indications of an improvement in heather cover. \n \nGood levels of livestock performance have been achieved for a hill farming system. However at the same stocking rate, organically managed ewes were consistently lighter and leaner than those managed conventionally. Lambs in the conventional flock grew 5 to 10% and 2 to 17% faster for single and twin lambs respectively. In the organically managed suckler herd, high levels of fertility were achieved. Stocking rates were reduced by 15% and 25% in two further organic flocks, and as a consequence, individual performance remaiined at a high level for a hill system. Calf growth rates averaged 0.8kg from birth to sale, as forward stores at 16-17 months of age. Premium markets have been found for organic store labs and cattle, demonstrating th epotential for better integration of organic hill and lowland systems. The health status of organically managed stock has also been good. The main health issues were trace element nutrition and parasite control. A system of alternative sheep and cattle grazing has been implemented to give better control of stomach worms, reducing the requirement for anthelmintic use compared to the conventional flock. Observational studies using homeopathy for orf and pasteurella pneumonia have shown promising results. \n \nPayments made under the Organic Aid Scheme, a premium of approx. 10% on the sale of organic store animals, and reduced forage costs have enabled an organic system to achieve similar, or improved, Net Farm Income relative to the conventional. At lower stocking densities, the individual performance of orgaic livestock animal was improved, and in appropriate circumstances the use of agri-environmental scheme payments can offset the reduction in output where stocking rates are reduced to accomadate an organic system. \n \nThe results continue to show that an organic hill and upland system can be competitive with conventional production. The unit is recognised as a valuable source of research and information on organic production. The next stage of the project will capitalise on this investment, using the resources available on the Unit to promote and further develop organic farming systems. further evaluation is planned (1998-2001) to take account of longer term trends in grassland and livestock performance, the continuing evolution of markets for organic produce and the development of production standards for organic livestock.", "year": 1998, "openAccessPdf": null, "authors": [{"authorId": "74888237", "name": "R.

In the present study, incidence of different types of dystocia was investigated in different seasons and parities in Holstein cows. One hundred and eighty two primiand multiparous cows with DYS were included in the study. The results showed significantly more calf births in anterior presentation to first-calf heifers compared to those born to cows in parities 2\u20133 or \u2265 4 (P\u22640.05). There was no significant difference in the number of calves born in anterior presentation between cows in parities 2\u20133 and those in parities \u22654 (P>0.05).

In addition, the results revealed that DYS due to foetopelvic disproportion (FPD) mostly affected the primiparous cows and that the multiparous cows were mostly affected by dystocia due to twin birth (TB), uterine inertia (UI) and uterine torsion (UT). Moreover, the results showed that significantly most DYS cases occurred during winter compared with spring, summer or autumn (P\u22640.05), of which the majority was due to FPD.

The actual plasma and faecal disposition of pour-on ivermectin in cattle was documented using an original pharmacokinetic model, and taking into account the oral ingestion of the topical drug following physiological licking as a secondary route of exposure. Six pairs of monozygotic twin cattle received successively one i.v. and two pour-on administrations of ivermectin at a 3-5-month interval. For one pour-on administration, the twins were separated into an unrestrained group and a group where self- and allo-licking were prevented. Ivermectin concentrations in the plasma and faeces were determined by HPLC. Licking resulted in a high intra-and inter-individual variability of systemic exposure after topical application. By the means of pharmacokinetic modelling, we showed that 58-87% of the pour-on dose was ingested, while only 10% was absorbed percutaneously. Approximately 72% of the ingested ivermectin transited directly into the faeces, resulting in a 7-fold higher faecal excretion of the parent drug than in the non-lickers.

Ovarian follicular development was synchronized among cows by a single i.m. injection of PGF2alpha on d 18 of the estrous cycle; six cows per population were slaughtered at 0, 24, 48, and 72 h after PGF2alpha. Jugular vein blood was collected from each animal at PGF2alpha injection and at 24-h intervals until slaughter. Ovaries of twinner cows contained more small (< or = 5 mm in diameter, P < 0.05), medium (5.1 to 9.9 mm, P < 0.05), and large (> or = 10.0 mm, P < 0.01) follicles and more (P < 0.01) CL than ovaries of controls. Follicular fluid concentrations of estradiol, androstenedione, testosterone, and progesterone reflected the stage of follicular development and were similar for twinner and control follicles at the same stage. Earlier initiation of follicular development and/or selection of twin-dominant follicles in some twinner cows resulted in greater concentrations of estradiol in plasma at 0, 24, and 48 h and of estradiol, androstenedione, and testosterone in follicular fluid of large follicles at 0 h after PGF2alpha for twinner vs. control cows (follicular status x time x population, P < 0.01). Binding activities of IGFBP-5 and -4 were absent or reduced (P < 0.01) in follicular fluid of developing medium and large estro-gen-active (estradiol:progesterone ratio > 1) follicles but increased with atresia. Only preovulatory Graafian follicles lacked IGFBP-2 binding, suggesting a possible role for IGFBP-2 in selection of the dominant follicle. Concentrations of IGF-I were twofold greater (P < 0.01), but GH (P = 0.10) and cholesterol (P < 0.05) were less in blood of twinners. Three generations of selection of cattle for twin ovulations and births enhanced ovarian follicular development as manifested by increased numbers of follicles within a follicular wave and subsequent selection of twin dominant follicles. Because gonadotropin secretion and ovarian steroidogenesis were similar for control and twinner cattle, enhanced follicular development in twinners may result from decreased inhibition by the dominant follicle(s), increased ovarian sensitivity to gonadotropins, and/or increased intragonadal stimulation, possibly by increased IGF-I.", "year": 2004, "openAccessPdf": null, "authors": [{"authorId": "5758319", "name": "S.

Slavery and slave trade marked the beginning of the woes of the Negroid world; there is no doubt that slave trade had been part and parcel of the blacks before the incursions of the westerners into their midst but this was made a profession by them in the best interest of developing their cities back home. Slavery took the centre stage of the fifteen century (15th) and entered the African societies through the exploration of the Portuguese through the desert. Slavery was a form of dependent labour performed by a non-family member. The slave was deprived of personal liberty and the right to move about geographically as he desired. There were limits on his capacity to make choices with regard to his occupation and sexual partners as well.It should be noted that slavery did a lot of damages to African world with its bitter pills still present in our day. One should be subjected to the multi-dimensions structure that the West continues to show to the African societies in the interest of removing totally or re-orientate the minds from the dastardly act of slavery. And no wonder Ivan Sertima writes concerning the effects of slavery on African soil as the worst that could have happened to a people and their land. He writes of the state of commotion in African continent thus:No human disaster . . . can equal in dimension of destructiveness the cataclysm that shook Africa. We are all familiar with the slave trade and the traumatic effect of this on the transplanted black, but few of us realise what horrors were wrought on Africa itself. Vast populations were uprooted and displaced, whole generations disappeared, Europeans diseases descended like the plague, decimating both cattle and people, cities and towns were abandoned, family networks disintegrated, kingdoms crumbled, the thread of cultural and historical continuity were so savagely torn asunder that henceforward one would have to think of two Africans: the one before and the one after the Holocaust (cited by Ngugi Wa Thiong'o, 1986:86).Slavery was the major problem of under-development in all ramifications to the African continent. Slavery is a reality that partly shaped African history and it is, after all, a major factor in European and American development. Without the free labor and dependent trade relationships dominated by western capitalists the level of development in western society would be significantly lower.The twin-partner of slavery is colonialism with partly evangelism, which began about 1500, following the European discoveries of a sea route around Africa's southern coast (1488) and of America (1492). With these events, sea power shifted from the Mediterranean to the Atlantic and to the emerging nation-states of Portugal, Spain, the Dutch Republic, France, and England. By discovery, conquest, and settlement, these nations expanded and colonised throughout the world, spreading European institutions and culture. Paul Harrison is of the opinion concerning colonialism in Inside the Third World thus:Colonial powers laid the foundation of the present divisions of the world into industrial nations on the one hand, and hewers of wood and drawers of water on the other. They wiped out indigenous industry and forced the colonies to buy their manufactures. They undermined the self-sufficiency of the Third World and transformed it into a source of raw materials for western industry. Sometimes they forced locals to grow the desired crops - as the French did with cotton in the Sahel or the Dutch with sugar in Indonesia. Sometimes they bought land or just seized it to set up plantations, drafting cheap labour to work them. In this way the colonial powers created the world economic order that still prevails today, of industrial centre and primary producing periphery, prosperous metropolis and poverty-stricken satellites (1987: 45). \u2026", "year": 2012, "openAccessPdf": null, "authors": [{"authorId": "115069190", "name": "Felix O.

Normal growth heifers received some concentrates up to 18 months of age and hay (or pasture) ad libitum. The slow growth heifers were limited to 69.5% of the total digestible nutrients (TDN) of the controls up to 91 wk, during which time they gained 81.3% as much body weight as the controls. In the 12-wk prepartum period, concentrates were fed to the slow growth heifers but not the controls. The supplemental prepartum feeding accelerated growth rate of the slow growth heifers above the controls, so that they were approaching the controls in body weight at calving. First lactation milk yields of the slow growth heifers averaged slightly, but not significantly, higher than those of the controls. Fat-corrected-milk (FCM) yields of the twins, purebred Holsteins, and purebred Jerseys, respectively, averaged 3,403, 4,696, and 2,837\u00a0kg for the controls, and 3,501, 4,796, and 3,337\u00a0kg for the slow growth heifers.
