Many existing genetic-analysis tools are not designed to handle such large data sets in a convenient manner and do not necessarily exploit the new opportunities that whole-genome data bring. To address these issues, we developed PLINK, an open-source C/C++ WGAS tool set. With PLINK, large data sets comprising hundreds of thousands of markers genotyped for thousands of individuals can be rapidly manipulated and analyzed in their entirety. As well as providing tools to make the basic analytic steps computationally efficient, PLINK also supports some novel approaches to whole-genome data that take advantage of whole-genome coverage. We introduce PLINK and describe the five main domains of function: data management, summary statistics, population stratification, association analysis, and identity-by-descent estimation. In particular, we focus on the estimation and use of identity-by-state and identity-by-descent information in the context of population-based whole-genome studies. This information can be used to detect and correct for population stratification and to identify extended chromosomal segments that are shared identical by descent between very distantly related individuals. Analysis of the patterns of segmental sharing has the potential to map disease loci that contain multiple rare variants in a population-based linkage analysis.", "year": 2007, "openAccessPdf": {"url": "http://www.cell.com/article/S0002929707613524/pdf", "status": "HYBRID"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2193588", "name": "S.

These theoretical underpinnings are translated into mathematical equations that allow the assessment of the contribution of observed (using DNA samples) and unobserved (using known genetic relationships) genetic variation to population variance in quantitative traits. Several statistical models for quantitative genetic analyses are described, such as models for the classical twin design, multivariate and longitudinal genetic analyses, extended twin analyses, and linkage and association analyses.

However, most monozygotic twin pairs are not identical; several types of phenotypic discordance may be observed, such as differences in susceptibilities to disease and a wide range of anthropomorphic features. There are several possible explanations for these observations, but one is the existence of epigenetic differences. To address this issue, we examined the global and locus-specific differences in DNA methylation and histone acetylation of a large cohort of monozygotic twins. We found that, although twins are epigenetically indistinguishable during the early years of life, older monozygous twins exhibited remarkable differences in their overall content and genomic distribution of 5-methylcytosine DNA and histone acetylation, affecting their gene-expression portrait. These findings indicate how an appreciation of epigenetics is missing from our understanding of how different phenotypes can be originated from the same genotype.", "year": 2005, "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://europepmc.org/articles/pmc1174919?pdf=render", "status": "GREEN"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "1999320", "name": "M.

The observed frequencies of maternal and paternal grandmothers with DZ twins differed significantly from the expectations under an X-linked mode of inheritance.

The autosomal dominant model revealed a strong robustness against a changing population prevalence and the loss of information due to the presence of same-sexed twin pairs of unknown zygosity.

Twins are relatively common and occur on average 13 times per 1000 maternities, though the twinning frequency varies over time and geographic location. This variation is mostly attributed to the differences in DZ twinning rate, since the monozygotic twinning rate is relatively constant. DZ twinning is in part under genetic control, with mothers of DZ twins reporting significantly more female family members with DZ twins than mothers of monozygotic twins. Maternal factors such as genetic history, advanced age and increased parity are known to increase the risk of DZ twins. Recent research confirmed that taller mothers and mothers with a high body mass index (30>) are at greater risk of DZ twinning. Seasonality, smoking, oral contraceptive use and folic acid show less convincing associations with twinning. Genetic analysis is beginning to identify genes contributing to the variation in twinning. Mutations in one of these genes (growth differentiation factor 9) are significantly more frequent in mothers of DZ twins. However, the mutations are rare and only account for a small part of the genetic contribution for twinning.", "year": 2008, "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://academic.oup.com/humupd/article-pdf/14/1/37/2467347/dmm036.pdf", "status": "BRONZE"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "3745355", "name": "Chantal Hoekstra"}, {"authorId": "1762156", "name": "Z.

The recent upsurge of interest in life-course epidemiology and the study of developmental influences on later health has provided a new impetus to study twins as a source of unique insights. Twins are of special interest because they provide naturally matched pairs where the confounding effects of a large number of potentially causal factors (such as maternal nutrition or gestation length) may be removed by comparisons between twins who share them. The traditional tool of epidemiological 'risk factor analysis' is the regression model, but it is not straightforward to transfer standard regression methods to twin data, because the analysis needs to reflect the paired structure of the data, which induces correlation between twins. This paper reviews the use of more specialized regression methods for twin data, based on generalized least squares or linear mixed models, and explains the relationship between these methods and the commonly used approach of analysing within-twin-pair difference values. Methods and issues of interpretation are illustrated using an example from a recent study of the association between birth weight and cord blood erythropoietin. We focus on the analysis of continuous outcome measures but review additional complexities that arise with binary outcomes. We recommend the use of a general model that includes separate regression coefficients for within-twin-pair and between-pair effects, and provide guidelines for the interpretation of estimates obtained under this model.", "year": 2005, "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://academic.oup.com/ije/article-pdf/34/5/1089/1815665/dyi153.pdf", "status": "BRONZE"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "145779280", "name": "J.

We extend the sib-pair multipoint mapping approach of Fulker et al. to general relative pairs. This multipoint IBD method uses the proportion of alleles shared identical by descent at genotyped loci to estimate IBD sharing at arbitrary points along a chromosome for each relative pair. We have derived correlations in IBD sharing as a function of chromosomal distance for relative pairs in general pedigrees and provide a simple framework whereby these correlations can be easily obtained for any relative pair related by a single line of descent or by multiple independent lines of descent. Once calculated, the multipoint relative-pair IBDs can be utilized in variance-component linkage analysis, which considers the likelihood of the entire pedigree jointly. Examples are given that use simulated data, demonstrating both the accuracy of QTL localization and the increase in power provided by multipoint analysis with 5-, 10-, and 20-cM marker maps.

In addition to telomere length differences between different age cohorts, considerable variation is present among individuals of the same age. To investigate whether this variation can be ascribed to genetic influences, we have measured the size of terminal restriction fragments (TRFs) in HaeIII-digested genomic DNA from 123 human MZ and DZ twin pairs 2-95 years of age. The average rate of telomere shortening was 31 bp/year, which is similar to that observed by others.

It is here attempted to ascertain the biometrical properties of a population of a more general type than has hitherto been examined, inheritance in which follows this scheme. It is hoped that in this way it will be possible to make a more exact analysis of the causes of human variability. The great body of available statistics show us that the deviations of a human measurement from its mean follow very closely the Normal Law of Errors, and, therefore, that the variability may be uniformly measured by the standard deviation corresponding to the square root of the mean square error. When there are two independent causes of variability capable of producing in an otherwise uniform population distributions with standard deviations \u03c31 and \u03c32, it is found that the distribution, when both causes act together, has a standard deviation . It is therefore desirable in analysing the causes of variability to deal with the square of the standard deviation as the measure of variability. We shall term this quantity the Variance of the normal population to which it refers, and we may now ascribe to the constituent causes fractions or percentages of the total variance which they together produce. It is desirable on the one hand that the elementary ideas at the basis of the calculus of correlations should be clearly understood, and easily expressed in ordinary language, and on the other that loose phrases about the \u201cpercentage of causation,\u201d which obscure the essential distinction between the individual and the population, should be carefully avoided.", "year": null, "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://zenodo.org/record/1428666/files/article.pdf", "status": "GREEN"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "49353544", "name": "R.

This approach, though, has faults, and we point out a few. A different approach to problems of multiple significance testing is presented. It calls for controlling the expected proportion of falsely rejected hypotheses -the false discovery rate. This error rate is equivalent to the FWER when all hypotheses are true but is smaller otherwise. Therefore, in problems where the control of the false discovery rate rather than that of the FWER is desired, there is potential for a gain in power. A simple sequential Bonferronitype procedure is proved to control the false discovery rate for independent test statistics, and a simulation study shows that the gain in power is substantial. The use of the new procedure and the appropriateness of the criterion are illustrated with examples.", "year": 1995, "openAccessPdf": null, "authors": [{"authorId": "1808156", "name": "Y.

The research also converges on the remarkable conclusion that these environmental influences make two children in the same family as different from one another as are pairs of children selected randomly from the population. The theme of the target article is that environmental differences between children in the same family (called \u201cnonshared environment\u201d) represent the major source of environmental variance for personality, psychopathology, and cognitive abilities. One example of the evidence that supports this conclusion involves correlations for pairs of adopted children reared in the same family from early in life. Because these children share family environment but not heredity, their correlation directly estimates the importance of shared family environment. For most psychological characteristics, correlations for adoptive \u201csiblings\u201d hover near zero, which implies that the relevant environmental influences are not shared by children in the same family. Although it has been thought that cognitive abilities represent an exception to this rule, recent data suggest that environmental variance that affects IQ is also of the nonshared variety after adolescence. The article has three goals: (1) To describe quantitative genetic methods and research that lead to the conclusion that nonshared environment is responsible for most environmental variation relevant to psychological development, (2) to discuss specific nonshared environmental influences that have been studied to date, and (3) to consider relationships between nonshared environmental influences and behavioral differences between children in the same family. The reason for presenting this article in BBS is to draw attention to the far-reaching implications of finding that psychologically relevant environmental influences make children in a family different from, not similar to, one another.", "year": 1987, "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://europepmc.org/articles/pmc3147063?pdf=render", "status": "GREEN"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2611761", "name": "R.

However, the reproductive consequences of such prebirth sex-ratio effects for offspring and their implications for maternal fitness remain unexplored. Here we investigate the effects of being gestated with a male co-twin for daughter lifetime reproductive success, and the fitness consequences for mothers of producing mixed-sex twins in preindustrial (1734\u20131888) Finns. We show that daughters born with a male co-twin have reduced lifetime reproductive success compared to those born with a female co-twin. This reduction arises because such daughters have decreased probabilities of marrying as well as reduced fecundity. Mothers who produce opposite-sex twins consequently have fewer grandchildren (and hence lower fitness) than mothers who produce same-sex twins. Our results are unlikely to be a consequence of females born with male co-twins receiving less nutrition because such females do not have reduced survival and increases in food availability fail to improve their reproductive success. Nor are our results explained by after-birth social factors (females growing up with similarly aged brothers) because females born with a male co-twin have reduced success even when their co-twin dies shortly after birth and are raised as singletons after birth. Our findings suggest that hormonal interactions between opposite-sex fetuses known to influence female morphology and behavior can also have negative effects on daughter fecundity and, hence, maternal fitness, and bear significant implications for adaptive sex allocation in mammals.", "year": 2007, "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://europepmc.org/articles/pmc1904168?pdf=render", "status": "GREEN"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "4864674", "name": "V.

Several other non-toxic extraction procedures have been published, but require either extensive dialysis (1) or the use of filters (2). A rapid, safe and inexpensive method was developed to simplify the deprotein-ization procedure. This method involves salting out of the cellular proteins by dehydration and precipitation with a saturated NaCl solution. Buffy coats of nucleated cells obtained from anticoagulated blood (ACD or EDTA) were resuspended in 15 ml polypropylene centrifugation tubes with 3 ml of nuclei lysis buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl t 400 mM NaCl and 2 mM Na 2 EDTA, pH 8.2). The cell lysates were digested overnight at 37\u00b0C with 0.2 ml of 10Z SDS and 0.5 ml of a protease K solution (1 mg protease K in 1Z SDS and 2 mM Na2EDTA). After digestion was complete, 1 ml of saturated NaCl (approximately 6M) was added to each tube and shaken vigorously for 15 seconds, followed by centrifugation at 2500 rpm for 15 minutes. The precipitated protein pellet was left at the bottom of the tube and the supernatant containing the DNA was transferred to another 15 ml polypropylene tube. Exactly 2 volumes of room temperature absolute ethanol was added and the tubes inverted several times until the DNA precipitated. The precipitated DNA strands were removed with a plastic spatula or pipette and transferred to a 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tube containing 100-200 pi TE buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, 0.2 mM Na 2 EDTA, pH 7.5). The DNA was allowed to dissolve 2 hours at 37\u00b0C before quantitating. The DNA obtained from this simple technique yielded quantities comparable to those obtained from phenol-chloroform extractions. The 260/280 ratios were consistently 1.8-2.0, demonstrating good deproteinization. Restrictions were performed using a number of different enzymes requiring high, medium or low salt concentrations, all resulting in complete restriction. This procedure has been used in our laboratory on several thousand blood samples for parentage, population and forensic studies. This technique is used with our non-isotopic hybridization procedures (3) rendering the entire process of RFLP analysis free of toxic materials.", "year": 1988, "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://academic.oup.com/nar/article-pdf/16/3/1215/4063153/16-3-1215.pdf", "status": "BRONZE"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "40664947", "name": "Shirley A.

Normal bovine, rat, and pig zygotes showed a demethylated paternal genome, suggesting active demethylation. In bovine embryos methylation was further reduced during cleavage up to the eight-cell stage, and this reduction in methylation was followed by de novo methylation by the 16-cell stage. In cloned one-cell embryos there was a reduction in methylation consistent with active demethylation, but no further demethylation occurred subsequently. Instead, de novo methylation and nuclear reorganization of methylation patterns resembling those of differentiated cells occurred precociously in many cloned embryos. Cloned, but not normal, morulae had highly methylated nuclei in all blastomeres that resembled those of the fibroblast donor cells.

The evidence that heredity plays some part comes from the observation that the incidence of the disease is higher among the relatives of affected individuals than it is in the general population. An increased incidence among relatives does not, however, go far toward providing an amwer to the important question of how strong the hereditary factor is, because the difference of incidence has no simple genetic interpretation. The relative importance of heredity and environment in such a case is clearly a problem of quantitative genetics. The usual methods of quantitative genetics, however, are not immediately applicable because these are based on correlations between relatives in respect of some \u2018graded\u2019 character measurable on a continuous scale Data in the form of incidences refer, in contrast, to an \u2018all-or-none\u2019 classification; individuals either have the disease or they do not. Though the affected individuals may sometimes be graded according to the degree of severity of their symptoms, the normal individuals, who are the majority, cannot be graded by the degree of their normality. The purpose of this paper is to suggest that the method developed in quantitative genetics for dealing with \u2018threshold characters \u2019 is applicable to data on the incidence of diseases, and that by its use we can get further towards an answer to the question of the relative importance of heredity and environment. (A fuller account of the method as applied in quantitative genetics will be found in Falconer, 1960.) The question of most general interest about the genetic causation of a disease that is not simply inherited is probably the relative importance of heredity as a causative agent. This questioii is meaningful only when stated in terms of amounts of variation; i.e. the variation between individuals that causes some to be affected and some not. What fraction of this variation is attributable to genetic differences between individuals? This fraction may be called the \u2018degree of genetic determination \u2019. Unfortumtely the degree of genetic determination cannot be estimated from human data, unless possibly by the use of twins, but a related quantity, the heritability \u2019, can be estimated. The distinction between the degree of genetic determination and the heritability is as follows. Two kinds of genetic variation have to be distinguished, \u2018additive\u2019 and \u2018non-additive\u2019. The additiw genetic variance is attributable to the average effects of genes considered singly, as transmitted in the gametes. The non-additive genetic variance is attributable to the additional effects of these genes when combined in diploid genotypes. It therefore arises from dominance and interaction between genes at different loci ; if there is no dominance or interaction there can be no non-additive variance.

They recommend an a level of 0.2 as a criterion for using their combined estimate of genetic variance [ 1 ]. The validity of this approach depends critically upon the hidden assumption that the total genetic variances of MZ and DZ are equal. Ignoring dominance, epistasis, environmental effects and genetic environmental interactions, the ratio of the additive variance in the among-pair mean square of MZ twins (or2AMz) to the additive variance in the among-pair mean square of DZ twins (0-2ADZ) could be greater than, equal to, or less than 1 depending upon whether 202AMZ is greater than, equal to, or less than 3/2o-2ADz. Thus, in the absence of prior knowledge that the total genetic variances are equal, the among-pair mean squares would appear to be of little value for the estimation of genetic variance. Note that even if the total genetic variances are not equal, the ratio of the within-pair variance of DZ to MZ twins remains a valid test for the presence of a genetic effect in DZ twins. This is because the within MZ mean square does not include genetic variation. Having detected evidence for genetic variation, the investigator must then judge whether the within-pair environmental variances of MZ and DZ twins are truly comparable, whether the trait is one which may be influenced by genetic-environmental interactions or the \"twin situation\" [2], and whether an estimate of genetic variance in DZ twins has any relevance to singletons. Of particular concern in the interpretation of within-pair variances are potential biases arising from differences in the biology of MZ and DZ twinning. Important differences in placentation are known to exist [3] which can contribute to variation in MZ twins [4]. In DZ twins the synergistic interactions that have been documented in unlike-sexed pairs for birth weight [5] and enzyme levels [6] raise the possibility that synergism may be a more general phenomenon, affecting genetically dissimilar like-sexed DZ twins as well. Finally, if superfetation occurs with appreciable frequency in man [7, 8], it would constitute a major bias in classical twin studies. However, most if not all of these potential sources of extraneous variation would influence the among as well as the within-pair components. For this reason, it seems unlikely that a valid test for genetic effects could be salvaged from an among-pair comparison in situations where the within-pair comparison has been rejected on biologic grounds. The issues involved are readily illustrated by a hypothetical example. If the", "year": 1974, "openAccessPdf": null, "authors": [{"authorId": "144990379", "name": "J.

An overdispersed Poisson model is used to account for both biological and technical variability. Empirical Bayes methods are used to moderate the degree of overdispersion across transcripts, improving the reliability of inference. The methodology can be used even with the most minimal levels of replication, provided at least one phenotype or experimental condition is replicated.

LBW is common among twins. It is unknown whether twin status per se is associated with risk of type 2 diabetes, and valid concordance rates of type 2 diabetes in twins on a lifetime perspective are lacking. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS A clinical study was done on a population-based cohort of same-sex elderly monozygotic (MZ) and dizygotic (DZ) twins (n = 297) and singleton control subjects (C) (n = 71) including measures of anthropometry and glucose tolerance. In addition, type 2 diabetes incidence cases in twins (n = 626) and singletons (n = 553) were identified through the National Diabetes Register. RESULTS Twins were more abdominally obese, insulin resistant, and glucose intolerant, as evidenced by a higher A1C (%) (means \u00b1 SD) (MZ: 6.0 \u00b1 1.0, DZ: 5.8 \u00b1 0.7, C: 5.6 \u00b1 0.3, P = 0.004) and 120-min post\u2013oral glucose tolerance test plasma glucose levels (in mmol/l) (MZ: 8.6 \u00b1 4.6, DZ: 8.4 \u00b1 3.9, C: 6.8 \u00b1 2.4, P = 0.003) compared with singletons. Importantly, twins had a higher prevalence of type 2 diabetes (MZ: 17.5% [95% CI 14.4\u201320.6], DZ: 15.7% [13.1\u201318.3], C: 5.6% [3.0\u20138.2], P = 0.03) together with a 60% higher incidence rate of type 2 diabetes compared with singletons. Cumulative concordance rates of type 2 diabetes to the age of 84 years were similar among elderly MZ (0.76 [0.68\u20130.84]) and DZ (0.71 [0.63\u20130.78]) twins.

Currently we register around 50% of all newborn multiples in The Netherlands. Their parents receive a questionnaire at registration and afterwards when the children are 2, 3, 5, 7, 10 and 12 years of age. Teachers are asked to rate the behavior of the children at ages 7, 10 and 12 years. Adolescent and young-adult twins were recruited through City Councils in the early 1990s. These twins, their parents and siblings participate in longitudinal survey studies that include items about health, fertility, lifestyle, addiction, personality and psychopathology, religion, socioeconomic status, and educational attainment. The total number of twins and multiples registered with the NTR is currently over 60,000. Subgroups of twins and siblings take part in studies of cognitive development, brain function and neuropsychological indices of attention processes, and molecular genetic studies of classical and behavioral cardiovascular risk factors. DNA samples are currently collected in selected twin families for two large linkage studies, which aim to find QTLs for anxious depression and for nicotine addiction. Sisters who are mothers of DZ twins contribute DNA samples for a linkage study of DZ twinning. Large cohorts of phenotyped family members from the general population are very valuable for genetic epidemiological studies and permit selection of informative families for gene finding studies.", "year": 2002, "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://pure.rug.nl/ws/files/66799326/netherlands_twin_register_a_focus_on_longitudinal_research.pdf", "status": "GREEN"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2234732747", "name": "D.

By identifying the intrauterine position of mice at cesarean delivery, we can predict reliably postnatal reproductive traits such as genital morphology, timing of puberty, length of estrous cycles, timing of reproductive senescence, sexual attractiveness, sexual behavior, aggressiveness, daily activity level, body weight and tissue enzyme activity in females; in males we can predict genital and brain morphology, sexual behavior, aggressiveness, daily activity level, body weight, and tissue enzyme activity. In mice, as in all mammals, male fetuses have greater concentrations of testosterone than do females. In addition, female mouse fetuses have greater circulating concentrations of estradiol than do male fetuses, a condition not found in all mammals. A mouse fetus positioned between males has greater concentrations of testosterone than does a fetus of the same sex positioned between females, and a fetus positioned between females has greater concentrations of estradiol than does a fetus of the same sex positioned between males. Gonadal steroids regulate differentiation of secondary sexual characteristics. Studies in which the effects of intrauterine position have been eliminated by exposing fetuses to steroid receptor blockers reveal the critical role of steroids in mediating this phenomenon. The intrauterine position phenomenon provides the only mammalian model for relating postnatal traits to concentrations of endogenous hormones to which individuals are exposed during fetal life. Results from studies using this naturally occurring experimental system in litter-bearing species have given insights concerning the consequences of individual differences in steroid concentrations during sexual differentiation that likely apply to all mammals. One specific hypothesis is that circulating estradiol may interact with testosterone in mediating some aspects of sexual differentiation in rodents and, thus, possibly in other mammals.", "year": 1989, "openAccessPdf": null, "authors": [{"authorId": null, "name": "F."}, {"authorId": null, "name": "S."}, {"authorId": "2238806171", "name": "vom"}, {"authorId": "2238806711", "name": "Saal"}]}

(Pp. 219+vii; illustrated. 60s.) London: Butterworths. 1962. In this stimulating book a group of experts have written on hydrogen-ion regulation and biochemistry in anaesthesia. This vast subject has been divided rather artificially and only certain aspects of biochemistry have been covered, and the divisions are more related to clinical practice than basic physiology and biochemistry. TIhe sections have been written by specialists in each field; the material they contain is beyond criticism, and there is valuable practical advice. Some chapters are well written, though others are not so easy to read. All are packed with information, and, what is equally valuable, they provide a source of further information for the inquiring mind, for the references and bibliographies are excellent. It is a pleasure to have complicated electrophysics presented in a readable way (\" Measurement of pH and Pco l\"); \"The Cholinesterases\" is an embracing account of difficult physiological and biochemical problems. Throughout the book there is a wealth of valuable material, indeed so much so that at times too much appears to have been attempted within the space available, as in \" Effects of Hypercapnia.\" These are minor criticisms of a good book, or perhaps it would be wiser to call it a collection of papers on chosen subjects, for there is understandably a lack of cohesion among the various chapters, and even some slight overlapping, which renders the whole less valuable than its several parts. No one can read these papers without interest and profit (and occasionally amusement) and they should fulfil the editor's hope that they will stimulate further interest in basic science. The book is well presented; the printing and paper are good, but the price will not encourage widespread use of the book among the younger members of our specialty. G. E. H.

Indeed, preimplantation undernutrition of rats elevated the systolic blood pressure of the resultant adult offspring. In this study, adult cardiovascular function is examined in a slower growing, non\u2013litter-bearing species after peri-implantation undernutrition. Eight ewes were fed to 50% equivalent food intake of 12 control ewes from 1 to 30 days (term \u2248147 days) only. Following consumption of an adequate diet to term, natural lambing, and then weaning, resting cardiovascular status and baroreflex function were examined in the resultant young adult offspring. Birth weight and postnatal growth to 1 year of age were unaffected by early undernutrition; however, nutrient-restricted sheep had increased pulse pressure, a reduced rate pressure product, and a leftward shift in their baroreflex function curve. Baroreflex sensitivity during angiotensin II infusion was also blunted in early nutrient-restricted sheep but the tachycardia following a reduction in central blood pressure appeared potentiated, relative to controls. The data suggest that peri-implantation undernutrition may program long-term cardiovascular dysfunction that ultimately increases the risk of hypertension later in life. An increase in regional angiotensin II activity during this critical early phase of development is a likely candidate mechanism for the effects observed. The data have broad implications for the health outcome of those offspring from mothers who were poorly nourished during early, often unknown pregnancy and for embryos artificially manipulated because of infertility treatment.", "year": 2004, "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/pdf/10.1161/01.HYP.0000126991.67203.7b", "status": "BRONZE"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "144189565", "name": "D.

DESIGN The prevalence of coronary heart disease was compared between those exposed to famine in late gestation (n\u2009=\u2009120), in mid-gestation (n\u2009=\u2009108), or in early gestation (n\u2009=\u200968), and those born in the year before the famine or those conceived in the year after the famine (non-exposed subjects, n\u2009=\u2009440). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Prevalence of coronary heart disease, defined as the presence of angina pectoris according to the Rose questionnaire, Q waves on the ECG, or a history of coronary revascularisation. RESULTS The prevalence of coronary heart disease was higher in those exposed in early gestation than in non-exposed people (8.8% v 3.2%; odds ratio adjusted for sex 3.0, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.1 to 8.1). The prevalence was not increased in those exposed in mid gestation (0.9%) or late gestation (2.5%).

We suggest that in both species the fetus exerts a critical role in the processes leading to birth, and that activation of the fetal hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis is a central mechanism by which the fetal influence on gestation length is exerted. Increased cortisol output from the fetal adrenal gland is a common characteristic across animal species. In primates, there is, in addition, increased output of estrogen precursor from the adrenal in late gestation. The end result, however, in primates and in sheep is similar: an increase in estrogen production from the placenta and intrauterine tissues. We have revised the pathway by which endocrine events associated with parturition in the sheep come about and suggest that fetal cortisol directly affects placental PGHS expression. In human pregnancy we suggest that cortisol increases PGHS expression, activity, and PG output in human fetal membranes in a similar manner. Simultaneously, cortisol contributes to decreases in PG metabolism and to a feed-forward loop involving elevation of CRH production from intrauterine tissues. In human pregnancy, there is no systemic withdrawal of progesterone in late gestation. We have argued that high circulating progesterone concentrations are required to effect regionalization of uterine activity, with predominantly relaxation in the lower uterine segment, allowing contractions in the fundal region to precipitate delivery. This new information, arising from basic and clinical studies, should further the development of new methods of diagnosing the patient at risk of preterm labor, and the use of scientifically based strategies specifically for the management of this condition, which will improve the health of the newborn.", "year": 2000, "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://academic.oup.com/edrv/article-pdf/21/5/514/8860292/edrv0514.pdf", "status": "BRONZE"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2216188", "name": "J.

Although the 'foetal origins of adult disease' hypothesis has significant relevance to preventative healthcare, the origin and biological mechanisms of foetal programming are largely unknown. Here, we investigate the origin, embryonic phenotype and potential maternal mechanisms of programming within an established rat model. Maternal low protein diet (LPD) fed during only the preimplantation period of development (0-4.25 days after mating), before return to control diet for the remainder of gestation, induced programming of altered birthweight, postnatal growth rate, hypertension and organ/body-weight ratios in either male or female offspring at up to 12 weeks of age. Preimplantation embryos collected from dams after 0-4.25 days of maternal LPD displayed significantly reduced cell numbers, first within the inner cell mass (ICM; early blastocyst), and later within both ICM and trophectoderm lineages (mid/late blastocyst), apparently induced by a slower rate of cellular proliferation rather than by increased apoptosis. The LPD regimen significantly reduced insulin and essential amino acid levels, and increased glucose levels within maternal serum by day 4 of development. Our data indicate that long-term programming of postnatal growth and physiology can be induced irreversibly during the preimplantation period of development by maternal protein undernutrition. Further, we propose that the mildly hyperglycaemic and amino acid-depleted maternal environment generated by undernutrition may act as an early mechanism of programming and initiate conditions of 'metabolic stress', restricting early embryonic proliferation and the generation of appropriately sized stem-cell lineages.", "year": 2000, "openAccessPdf": null, "authors": [{"authorId": "90452923", "name": "W.

Their experiments resulted in several sheep [5] being born in July 1996, one of which was a sheep [5] named Dolly born 5 July 1996. Dolly was the first sheep [5] cloned and developed from the nuclei of fully differentiated adult cells, rather than from the nuclei of early embryonic cells. They published their results in \"Viable Offspring Derived from Fetal and Adult Mammalian Cells\" (abbreviated Viable Offspring) on 27 February 1997. In 1993, Wilmut, Campbell, and collaborators experimented on cow [6] embryos at the Roslin Institute. These experiments helped develop the theory that differentiated cells in an appropriate environment could develop similar to embryonic cells. For the process of cloning [4] organisms without defects, the cow [6] embryo experiments revealed the optimal cell cycle stage and the need to avoid chromosomal damage when transferring nuclei. Further information came from experiments described in the 1996 article titled \"Sheep Cloned by Nuclear Transfer from a Cultured Cell Line.\" Campbell, McWhir, Ritchie, and Wilmut conducted experiments in which they cloned sheep [5] from an established embryonic cell line experiments that produced the sheep [5] named Megan and Morag. The scientists developed techniques and concepts from the sheep [5] experiments, including how transferring nuclei during the resting state in the cell cycle called quiescence improves success rates. In the experiments, the scientist removed the nucleus [7] from an egg [8] cell and inserted a donor egg [8] cell to replace the removed nucleus [7] , a modified version of the technique called somatic cell nuclear transfer [9] .", "year": 2014, "openAccessPdf": null, "authors": [{"authorId": "89078963", "name": "Zane Bartlett"}]}

This covers the period of sexual organogenesis in males from the initial differentiation of the testes to the final establishment of most male structures. Twenty-nine pregnancies resulting in heterosexual fetuses with fused chorions and vascular anastomoses provided forty-eight presumptive freemartins. The genital tract was studied histologically and gonadal size was determined by the paper weight method. No difference was observed between control females and presumptive freemartins up to 48 days. Thereafter, growth of the presumptive ovaries practically stopped in freemartins and the diameter of the upper part of their M\\l=u\"\\llerianducts decreased, as in males. Contrary to older views, the first freemartin effects occurred at the same stage (49 to 52 days) in all the presumptive freemartins. Ovarian and M\\l=u\"\\llerianinhibition begins simultaneously and a significant correlation between the degree of inhibition of both structures was obtained. The penis, scrotum and prostate were absent in all freemartins until Day 60. In only one case was the ano-genital distance slightly increased. A delayed appearance of seminal vesicles was found in three out of seven freemartins at 61 and 62 days. There was a notable absence of seminiferous tubules in the gonads of all these freemartins. It is suggested that if these tubules are present after birth it is because they have developed later. The factors responsible for the freemartin effect still remain to be discovered. Ovarian and M\\l=u\"\\llerianinhibitions occur during the period of time when the external genitalia of males become masculinized. This suggests that a factor of male origin which inhibits both the ovaries and the M\\l=u\"\\llerianducts and which is distinct from the masculinizing hormone could be involved.

Our aim was to investigate nephron endowment and renal filtration surface area in fetal sheep in which IUGR resulted from late gestational umbilico-placental embolization (UPE) or natural twinning. UPE was performed between 120 and 140 d of gestation (term \u223c147 d). At autopsy (140 d), body weights of UPE and twin fetuses were, respectively, 34% and 28% lower than controls. Kidneys were sampled using a smooth fractionator approach and glomerular number was estimated using a physical disector/fractionator technique. Glomerular capillary length and filtration surface area were estimated using unbiased stereological techniques. Although relative kidney weights (grams per kilogram body weight) were not different between groups, nephron endowment was 40% lower in twin fetuses compared with controls (34.3 \u00b1 10.6 \u00d7 104 and 55.9 \u00b1 19.8 \u00d7 104, respectively; p < 0.05); UPE did not alter nephron number (50.7 \u00b1 13.2 \u00d7 104). There was no difference in the glomerular capillary length or surface area between the UPE and control fetuses.

In comparison to twins, the triplet lamb is; lighter, more metabolically challenged, has lower body temperature, and receives less colostrum and milk which combined results in lower survival rates and weaning weights. While scientifically based management guidelines are available for singletons and twins, guidelines are generally lacking for triplets. Although there is some knowledge on the impacts of nutrition, further studies are required to examine the impacts of varying feeding regimens in pregnancy and lactation, across the body condition range. Characterising the impacts of shelter and other paddock factors, stocking rate, mob size and human intervention would also be of benefit.

Effects of mating season (August, October, and December) were estimated for survival and growth traits. Data were collected on 4,320 F1 lambs sired by 102 purebred rams over 3 yr. Birth weight was recorded on all lambs, and subsequent BW were adjusted to 56 (weaning), 70, and 140 d of age (n = 3,713, 3,654, and 3,579 observations, respectively). Survival of dam-reared progeny (n = 4,065) to weaning was recorded. Each year, wethers from October matings were slaughtered in three groups at 25, 29, and 33 wk of age to obtain carcass data (n = 546). In addition to standard carcass traits, resistive impedance measurements were recorded on the warm carcass to predict lean mass. Dam breed (P = 0.37) did not influence lamb survival to weaning, but sire breed (P < 0.05) was important. Romanov-sired lambs excelled in survival rate to weaning (94.1%), followed by Finn-sheep (93.0%), Texel (90.7%), Dorset (90.0%), and Montadale (89.1%) sired progeny. Lower (P < 0.01) postweaning growth rate was observed for Texel (267 g/d) and Finnsheep (272 g/d) sired progeny than for Dorset (285 g/d), Montadale (282 g/d), and Romanov (278 g/d) sired progeny. Sire breed and dam breed were generally significant for most carcass traits. Breed differences in distribution of carcass fat and carcass shape were detected; however, carcass composition was similar for all sire breeds when compared at a constant carcass weight. When evaluated at a constant 12th-rib fat depth, carcasses of lambs from Finnsheep, Romanov, and Texel sires produced 1 to 1.5 kg less (P < 0.001) predicted lean mass per lamb than carcasses of lambs from Dorset and Montadale sires.

Catheters were surgically implanted in fetal arteries in twins, the amniotic sac, and a maternal artery and vein. Blood was drawn daily until labor was imminent or the twins were delivered. Fetal pituitaries and adrenals were removed for in vitro measurements. Analyses included blood gases and cortisol (daily) and plasma cortisol, adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), and estrogens (at completion). Twins were assigned retrospectively to group A or B, depending on which cortisol was first elevated ( group A) above baseline. Group A fetuses consistently had higher cortisol until term. All group A fetuses also first had elevated ACTH. In four of four sets of twins of both sexes, the male was in group A. There were no differences between fetuses in plasma estrogens or pituitary ACTH response to stimulation, but adrenal cells from group A fetuses were more responsive. These data suggest that adrenal activity is increased in one twin consistently, with the difference being attributable to the responsiveness of adrenal cells to ACTH rather than pituitary responsiveness to either corticotropin-releasing hormone or vasopressin.

Variance components for pre- and postweaning growth, body weight, and measures of feed efficiency were estimated from data collected on 1,047 Targhee lambs over 7 yr. Approximately 21 d after weaning, lambs were group-fed for 4 wk, with ad libitum access to a diet of 37% whole barley grain and 63% pelleted alfalfa hay. Lambs were then individually fed for 6 wk. Lambs were then returned to group feeding for another 4-wk period. The mean feed conversion ratio (gain/intake) for the individual feeding period was 0.11. Mean postweaning ADG for the total 14-wk feeding period was 0.26 kg. (Co)variance components were estimated from single- and two-trait animal models using REML. The selection strategies compared included direct selection, index selection, and restricted index selection. Estimates of (co)variances derived from single- and two-trait models were similar, except for mid-test body weight. Preweaning growth had a low heritability estimate (0.03 +/- 0.04) compared with postweaning growth measures (0.25 to 0.39), but all measures of growth were highly correlated (r2 > 0.98). Heritability estimates of measures of gain efficiency were variable (total feed intake = 0.39; feed conversion ratio = 0.26; residual feed intake = 0.26). Total feed intake was strongly correlated genetically with feed conversion ratio (0.79) and residual feed intake (0.77). The estimate of genetic correlation between feed conversion ratio and residual feed intake was low (0.23). Comparison of selection strategies showed the superiority of index selection (ADG, total feed, body weight) for economic improvement compared with other strategies. Economic response to direct selection for ADG was at least twice that for direct selection for feed conversion ratio or against total feed intake, and that for restricted indices (selecting against residual feed, while holding body weight and/or gain constant).

Pregnant ewes were either well nourished (control group; n = 22) or undernourished (UN; 50% reduction in maternal nutrient intake; n = 23) during the last 30 days of pregnancy. Acute hypoglycemia was induced by intrafetal administration of insulin between 125 and 130 days gestation (control, n = 7; UN, n = 12) and between 138 and 141 days gestation (control, n = 6; UN = 9). Fetal plasma glucose concentrations were significantly lower (P < 0.005) in the UN compared with the control group throughout the insulin infusion period at both gestational age ranges. In the control group, there was no fetal ACTH response to insulin infusion before 135 days gestation, but there was a significant (P < 0.001) response after 136 days gestation. In the UN group, there was a significant ACTH response to insulin infusion both before and after 135 days gestation, and there was no difference in the fetal ACTH response between the two gestational age ranges. The plasma cortisol responses to insulin were greater (P < 0.001) after 136 days compared with before 135 days gestation in both the UN and control groups. In the control group there was no significant relationship between basal fetal plasma ACTH and glucose concentrations between 115-135 days gestation or between 136-145 days gestation. In the UN group, fetal glucose ranged from 0.5-2.0 mM, and plasma ACTH and glucose concentrations were inversely related at 115-135 days gestation [log ACTH = -0.31 (glucose) + 2.21; r = -0.37; P < 0.001] and at 136-145 days gestation [log ACTH = -0.40 (glucose) + 2.50; r = -0.54; P < 0.001]. When the UN and control groups were combined, fetal plasma ACTH concentrations were significantly greater (F = 13.5; P < 0.05) when plasma glucose concentrations were less than 1.0 mM at either 115-135 days or 136-147 days gestation. Similarly, fetal plasma cortisol concentrations were also significantly greater (F = 18.7; P < 0.05) when plasma glucose concentrations were less than 1.0 mM at each gestational age range. Therefore, there is an increased sensitivity of the fetal hypothalamo-pituitary axis to acute falls in glucose concentrations below 1.2 mM after 135 days compared with earlier in gestation. The fetal hypothalamo-pituitary axis can respond, however, when plasma glucose concentrations fall below 1.0 mM, before and after 135 days gestation, independently of whether the low glucose concentrations are a consequence of insulin-induced hypoglycemia or maternal nutrient restriction.", "year": 2001, "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://academic.oup.com/endo/article-pdf/142/5/1778/10364057/endo1778.pdf", "status": "BRONZE"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "7949003", "name": "L.

Data identification All papers published between March 1996 and March 2000 that examined the relationship between birth weight and systolic blood pressure were identified and combined with the papers examined in a previous review. Subjects More than 444 000 male and female subjects aged 0\u201384 years of all ages and races. Results Eighty studies described the relationship of blood pressure with birth weight. The majority of the studies in children, adolescents and adults reported that blood pressure fell with increasing birth weight, the size of the effect being approximately 2 mmHg/kg. Head circumference was the only other birth measurement to be most consistently associated with blood pressure, the magnitude of the association being a decrease in blood pressure by approximately 0.5 mmHg/cm. Skeletal and non-skeletal postnatal catch-up growth were positively associated with blood pressure, with the highest blood pressures occurring in individuals of low birth weight but high rates of growth subsequently. Conclusions Both birth weight and head circumference at birth are inversely related to systolic blood pressure. The relationship is present in adolescence but attenuated compared to both the pre- and post-adolescence periods. Accelerated postnatal growth is also associated with raised blood pressure.", "year": 2000, "openAccessPdf": null, "authors": [{"authorId": "51013580", "name": "R.

Adipose and skeletal muscle were then sampled after humane euthanasia and were analyzed for expression of insulin-signaling proteins and GLUT4. Between groups, birth weight of singletons was similar and increased relative to twins. At 1 yr of age, weights were similar between groups. The areas under the curve for glucose and insulin during the IVGTT were greater in NRL vs. other groups, indicating glucose intolerance.

DESIGN--This was a follow up study of (1) men born during 1920-30 whose birthweights and weights at one year were recorded at the time by health visitors; and (2) men born during 1935-43 whose size at birth was measured in detail. The main outcome measure was the ratio of waist circumference to hip girth. SETTING--Hertfordshire and Preston, England. SUBJECTS--Subjects were 845 men born in east Hertfordshire who still live there; and 239 men born in Preston who still live in or close to the city. MAIN RESULTS--After allowing for body mass index, mean waist to hip ratio fell with increasing birthweight and rose as the ratio of placental weight to birthweight increased. These trends were independent of duration of gestation and therefore reflected retarded fetal growth. Waist to hip ratio also fell with increasing weight at one year. All these trends were independent of adult height, alcohol consumption, smoking, social class, and age.

It is regulated principally by the ovulation rate, so that primates and large farm species commonly have a single offspring. Previously, several mutations have been identified in sheep which increase the naturally low ovulation rate; although in some cases homozygous ewes are infertile. In the present study we present a detailed characterization of a novel mutation in growth differentiation factor 9 (GDF9), found in Icelandic Thoka sheep. This mutation is a single base change (A1279C) resulting in a nonconservative amino acid change (S109R) in the C-terminus of the mature GDF9 protein, which is normally expressed in oocytes at all stages of development. Genotyping all animals for which reproductive records were available confirmed this mutation to be associated with increased fecundity in heterozygous ewes and infertility in homozygotes. Analysis of homozygote ovarian morphology and a number of genes normally activated in growing follicles showed that GDF9 was not involved in oocyte activation, but in subsequent development of the follicle. This study highlights the importance of oocyte factors in regulating fertility and provides new information for structural analysis and investigation of the potentially important sites of dimerization or translational modifications required to produce biologically active GDF9. It also provides the basis for the utilization of these animals to enhance sheep production.", "year": 2009, "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://rep.bioscientifica.com/downloadpdf/journals/rep/138/6/921.pdf", "status": "BRONZE"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "38022879", "name": "L.

Sheep (9\u201310 per group) were immunized with keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH; control), a GDF9-specific peptide conjugated to KLH (GDF9 peptide), a BMP15-specific peptide conjugated to KLH (BMP15 peptide), or the mature region of oBMP15 conjugated to KLH (oBMP15 mature protein) for a period of 7 mo and the effects of these treatments on various ovarian parameters such as ovarian follicular development, ovulation rate, and plasma progesterone concentrations evaluated. Also in the present study, we examined, by immunohistochemistry, the cellular localizations of GDF9 and BMP15 proteins in the ovaries of lambs. Both GDF9 and BMP15 proteins were localized specifically within ovarian follicles to the oocyte, thereby establishing for the sheep that the oocyte is the only intraovarian source of these growth factors. Immunization with either GDF9 peptide or BMP15 peptide caused anovulation in 7 of 10 and 9 of 10 ewes, respectively, when assessed at ovarian collection. Most ewes (7 of 10) immunized with oBMP15 mature protein had a least one observable estrus during the experimental period, and ovulation rate at this estrus was higher in these ewes compared with those immunized with KLH alone. In both the KLH-GDF9 peptide- and KLH-BMP15 peptide-treated ewes, histological examination of the ovaries at recovery (i.e., \u223c7 mo after the primary immunization) showed that most animals had few, if any, normal follicles beyond the primary (i.e., type 2) stage of development. In addition, abnormalities such as enlarged oocytes surrounded by a single layer of flattened and/or cuboidal granulosa cells or oocyte-free nodules of granulosa cells were often observed, especially in the anovulatory ewes. Passive immunization of ewes, each given 100 ml of a pool of plasma from the GDF9 peptide- or BMP15 peptide-immunized ewes at 4 days before induction of luteal regression also disrupted ovarian function. The ewes given the plasma against the GDF9 peptide formed 1\u20132 corpora lutea but 3 of 5 animals did not display normal luteal phase patterns of progesterone concentrations. The effect of plasma against the BMP15 peptide was more dramatic, with 4 of 5 animals failing to ovulate and 3 of 5 ewes lacking surface-visible antral follicles at laparoscopy. By contrast, administration of plasma against KLH did not affect ovulation rate or luteal function in any animal. In conclusion, these findings support the hypothesis that, in mammals with a low ovulation rate phenotype, both oocyte-derived GDF9 and BMP15 proteins are essential for normal follicular development, including both the early and later stages of growth.", "year": 2002, "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://academic.oup.com/biolreprod/article-pdf/67/6/1777/10557689/biolreprod1777.pdf", "status": "BRONZE"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "3826197", "name": "J.

These tests were carried out in seven strains of sheep (Javanese, Thoka, Woodlands, Olkuska, Lacaune, Belclare, and Cambridge) in which inheritance patterns have suggested the presence of major genes affecting prolificacy and in the prolific Garole sheep of India, which have been proposed as the ancestor of Australian Booroola Merinos. The FecB mutation was found in the Garole and Javanese sheep but not in Thoka, Woodlands, Olkuska, Lacaune, Belclare, and Cambridge sheep. None of the sheep tested had the FecXI mutation. These findings present strong evidence to support historical records that the Booroola gene was introduced into Australian flocks from Garole (Bengal) sheep in the late 18th century. It is unknown whether Javanese Thin-tailed sheep acquired the Booroola gene directly from Garole sheep from India or via Merinos from Australia.

The effect of FecB is additive for ovulation rate (increasing by about 1.6 corpora lutea per cycle for each copy) and has been mapped to sheep chromosome 6q23\u201331, which is syntenic to human chromosome 4q21\u201325. Bone morphogenetic protein IB (BMP-IB) receptor (also known as ALK-6), which binds members of the transforming growth factor-\u03b2 (TGF-\u03b2) superfamily, is located in the region containing the FecB locus. Booroola sheep have a mutation (Q249R) in the highly conserved intracellular kinase signaling domain of the BMP-IB receptor. The mutation segregated with the FecB phenotype in the Booroola backcross and half-sib flocks of sheep with no recombinants. The mutation was not found in individuals from a number of sheep breeds not derived from the Booroola strain. BMPR-IB was expressed in the ovary and in situ hybridization revealed its specific location to the oocyte and the granulosa cell. Expression of mRNA encoding the BMP type II receptor was widespread throughout the ovary. The mutation in BMPR-IB found in Booroola sheep is the second reported defect in a gene from the TGF-\u03b2 pathway affecting fertility in sheep following the recent discovery of mutations in the growth factor, GDF9b/BMP15.", "year": 2001, "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://academic.oup.com/biolreprod/article-pdf/64/4/1225/10643953/biolreprod1225.pdf", "status": "BRONZE"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "47481828", "name": "T.

Homozygous BMP15 or GDF9 mutations raise female sterility due to a failure of normal ovarian follicle development, whereas heterozygous animals for BMP15 or GDF9 as well as heterozygous and homozygous animals for BMP receptor type IB show increased ovulation rates. In the present work, a new naturally occurring mutation in the BMP15 gene in the high prolific Lacaune sheep breed is described. The identified variant is a C53Y missense nonconservative substitution leading to the aminoacidic change of a cysteine with a tyrosine in the mature peptide of the protein. As for other mutations found in the same gene, this is associated with an increased ovulation rate and sterility in heterozygous and homozygous animals, respectively. Further in vitro studies showed that the C53Y mutation was responsible for the impairment of the maturation process of the BMP15 protein, resulting in a defective secretion of both the precursor and mature peptide.

The synthesis of milk requires, in part, the mobilization of bodily reserves to nourish developing young. Numerous hypotheses have been advanced to predict how mothers will differentially invest in sons and daughters, however few studies have addressed sex-biased milk synthesis. Here we leverage the dairy cow model to investigate such phenomena. Using 2.39 million lactation records from 1.49 million dairy cows, we demonstrate that the sex of the fetus influences the capacity of the mammary gland to synthesize milk during lactation. Cows favor daughters, producing significantly more milk for daughters than for sons across lactation. Using a sub-sample of this dataset (N\u200a=\u200a113,750 subjects) we further demonstrate that the effects of fetal sex interact dynamically across parities, whereby the sex of the fetus being gestated can enhance or diminish the production of milk during an established lactation. Moreover the sex of the fetus gestated on the first parity has persistent consequences for milk synthesis on the subsequent parity. Specifically, gestation of a daughter on the first parity increases milk production by \u223c445 kg over the first two lactations. Our results identify a dramatic and sustained programming of mammary function by offspring in utero.

At approximately 16 weeks prepartum the ewes were divided into two similar groups and fed to maintain the live weight and body condition of one group (fat), and to decrease that of the other group (lean). At 8 weeks prepartum mean differences of 14kg live weight and two scores of body condition had been created between the groups. During the last 6 weeks of pregnancy food was rationed to all ewes per unit of live weight to provide the theoretical requirements of Blackface ewes in late pregnancy. Both groups of ewes made similar live-weight gains in late pregnancy and blood plasma F.F.A. values confirmed that the ewes had been similarly nourished regardless of live weight or body condition. During early lactation food was restricted to fat and lean groups of ewes for either a 2- or 4- week period followed by ad lib. feeding for the remainder of lactation. A lamb-suckling technique was used to measure milk production during a 10-week lactation. During the first and second weeks of lactation the mean milk production of groups of both fat and lean ewes was approximately 2\u00b71 and 1\u00b73 kg/day for twin- and single-suckled ewes respectively. Ad lib. feeding following restricted feeding during the first 2 weeks of lactation resulted in increased milk production of fat and of lean ewes to mean maximum values of approximately 2\u00b77 and 1\u00b77 kg/day for twin- and single-suckled ewes respectively. In contrast, groups of ewes which had restricted feeding for the first 4 weeks of lactation showed almost no increase in milk production when fed ad lib. During the extended period of restricted feeding the milk production of twin-suckled ewes which were fat at parturition was significantly greater than that of twin-suckled lean ewes but there was no difference with singlesuckled ewes. All groups of ewes lost similar amounts of live weight and body condition during their respective periods of restricted feeding. In the respective 6-week periods following ad lib. feeding the live-weight gain of the lean ewes was significantly greater than that of the fat ewes (339 v. 222 and 356 v. 250 g/day for twin- and single-suckled ewes respectively), but they did not attain parity of live weight by the end of lactation. When fed ad lib. the mean intake of all groups of ewes attained similar maximum values of approximately 2\u00b72 kg D.O.M./day. The results indicate that the stage of lactation is an overriding factor governing the response to increased nutrition and that body condition of ewes at parturition acts as a buffer between nutrient intake and nutrient requirements for lactation. It is suggested that when body reserves of ewes are severely depleted, factors other than nutrient intake may become limiting to milk production.", "year": 1970, "openAccessPdf": null, "authors": [{"authorId": "84019936", "name": "J.

Ewes were milked by machine, after the intravenous injection of 3 i.u. posterior pituitary extract, at the rate of 20 to 30/hr, and then returned to pasture with their lambs which were prevented from sucking by covering the udders. Approximately 4 hr later the ewes were milked again; the yield over the known time interval was recorded and sampled for analysis. There was no significant variation in the yield, or fat and protein contents, or the milk obtained over six different 4 hr periods in a day. It was concluded that the technique gave reliable estimates of the rate of secretion and that these could be converted directly to estimates of yield per day of milk and its constituents. Such estimates, if made once or twice weekly, would also be likely to give reliable data on the course of lactation, which would be determined primarily by the mutual behaviour, largely undisturbed, of ewe and lamb. The lactations of 50 fine-wool Merino ewes grazing improved pastures that provided abundant feed were recorded. For the majority of ewes, daily yield increased until a mean maximum of 1400\u20131600 g/day was attained at 3 weeks post partum, and then declined at the rate of 15\u201320 g/day for 6 to 8 weeks. The total yield over 10 weeks was about 80 kg and at 14 weeks was 90\u2013100 kg; half or more of these amounts had been produced by the end of the fifth week.

In the above cases, estimation of variance components is usually accomplished by computing the mean squares in the standard analysis of variance, equating these mean squares to their expectations, and solving for the unknown variances. These techniques are described in many statistical textbooks. Unfortunately, research workers in some of those fields in which much use is made of variance component estimates are unable to obtain data which have the above described characteristics.

The resulting 30 to 50% increase in maternal requirements for these nutrients is met partly by increased voluntary intake and partly by an array of maternal metabolic adaptations. The latter include increased hepatic gluconeogenesis from endogenous substrates, decreased peripheral tissue glucose utilization, increased fatty acid mobilization from adipose tissue, and, possibly, increased amino acid mobilization from muscle. Within 4 d of parturition, mammary demands for glucose, amino acids, and fatty acids are several-fold those of the pregnant uterus before term. Even unusual postparturient increases in voluntary intake cannot satisfy this increased nutrient demand. Therefore, rates of hepatic gluconeogenesis and adipose fat mobilization are greatly accelerated. Concomitant changes in amino acid metabolism include increased hepatic protein synthesis and, possibly, decreased amino acid catabolism, and increased peripheral mobilization of amino acids. Insulin resistance in adipose tissue and muscle, developed during late pregnancy, continues postpartum; adipose lipolytic responsiveness and sensitivity to adrenergic agents are increased postpartum beyond their levels during late pregnancy.

Rates of accumulation of these components in the gravid uterus (sum of all uterine contents) and fetus were described by linear or quadratic equations.

Genetic differentiations (F(ST) values) between all pairs of populations, except between sub-alpine populations, were significantly different from zero (P < 0.001). Cluster analysis of morphological characters and a dendrogram constructed from genetic distances were broadly consistent with the classification into fat-tailed, thin-tailed and fat-rumped sheep. Bayesian cluster analysis using microsatellite markers indicated that there has been further genetic differentiation after the initial introduction of sheep into Ethiopia. Investigation of factors associated with genetic variation showed that an isolation-by-distance model, independently of other factors, explained most of the observed genetic variation.

The specific studies deal with growth, survival, causes of mortality, risk factors for major causes of mortality, outbreak investigations, maedi-visna, and economics of anthelmintic treatment and supplementation. Results of studies on lamb growth and survival revealed that Horro lambs were heavier than Menz lambs both at birth and weaning. Birth weight increased significantly from the first to third parity; was higher for lambs born as singles than multiples, and for male than female lambs. Lambs born in the wet season had higher birth weight, pre-weaning average daily weight gain and weaning weight than their contemporaries born in the dry season. Pre- and post-weaning mortalities were 33.1% and 54.5% for the Horro and 19.2% and 25.9% for the Menz sheep. Cumulative mortality up to yearling was more than twice as high for Horro than for Menz lambs (69.6 vs. 30.2%). Mortality was higher for lambs born in the dry season compared to those born in the wet season, for multiple-born lambs than singles, and for male lambs than females. There was a positive relationship within breed between birth weight and survival at all ages. Causes of mortality were similar in Horro and Menz, pneumonia accounting for more than half of all deaths, followed by digestive and gastrointestinal problems, endoparasitism, starvation-mismothering-exposure complex and septicaemia. Within breed, sires were a significant source of variation for lamb growth and survival. A retrospective case-control study conducted on 6718 sheep of the Horro and Menz breeds on risk factors for mortality associated with respiratory diseases revealed that 54.4% of total mortality was due to respiratory diseases. Annual mortality associated with respiratory diseases ranged from 6.3 to 19.0%, and breed, sex and month of the year were significant sources of variation. Mortality associated with respiratory diseases was higher for the Horro than for the Menz breed (16.5% vs. 12.4%), and between October and March than between April and September. There was a significant relationship between monthly mortality associated with respiratory diseases and monthly average minimum air temperatures and with the average monthly daily deviation between maximum and minimum air temperatures. Estimation of genetic and environmental parameters for growth traits showed that the maternal genetic component was important for birth weight, weaning weight and pre-weaning average daily gain. The contribution of the permanent environmental component in the models was also substantial but less important than the common (litter) environmental component. Total heritability estimates for Menz and Horro were generally low to moderate at 0.22 vs. 0.26 for birth weight, 0.15 vs. 0.12 for weaning weight, 0.21 vs. 0.04 for yearling weight, 0.14 vs. 0.11 for pre-weaning average daily gain, and 0.11 vs. 0.11 for post-weaning average daily gain. Estimates of genetic parameters on lamb survival from the mixed Linear Model and Survival Analysis were compared. For the mixed Linear Model, survival defined as a binary trait measured at different pre-determined time, and for the Survival Analysis, survival defined as time to respective periods for lamb surviving (censored records) and time to death (uncensored records) was used. The maternal genetic effect was important for lamb survival at all survival periods. The heritabilities from Survival Analysis (0.3% to 18.5%) were higher than those obtained with the mixed Linear Model (0.5% to 5.6%). The accuracies of predicted breeding values were also higher for the traits analysed with Survival Analysis. Some limitations of Survival Analysis are discussed. An investigation into a respiratory diseases outbreak in Menz and Awassi \u00d7 Menz crossbred sheep revealed that multi-factorial causes were involved. These include peste des petits ruminants (72.3%, serologically confirmed), lungworms, maedi-visna, bacterial bronchopneumonia, enzootic pneumonia and fungal infections. A follow-up serological study revealed that 74% were positive for maedi-visna antibodies in sheep of two ranches, but antibodies for maedi-visna were not detected in sheep and goats from elsewhere in Ethiopia. The maedi-visna was detected in the indigenous Menz and imported pure Awassi and crossbreds of Menz with Awassi, Hampshire, and Corriedale with a significant breed difference in prevalence. This result suggested that the maedi-visna might have been introduced into Ethiopia through sheep importations. The profitability of anthelmintic treatment and supplementation was evaluated in a 2\u00d72\u00d73 factorial experiment under natural sub-clinical helminthosis challenge using partial budget analysis. Supplemented sheep had significantly higher marginal profit per sheep than non-supplemented sheep. Likewise, the anthelmintic treated sheep performed significantly better than their non-treated contemporaries. The indigenous Menz and 50% Awassi \u00d7 Menz were significantly more profitable during the experimental period than the 75% Awassi \u00d7 Menz crosses, but ranking of genotypes changed with age. Timely health and management interventions on identified key factors and utilising genetic variation through selection would improve lamb survival and growth. Life-time assessment of economic returns helps to draw early decisions in sheep improvement programmes. Sheep breeding objectives are discussed in the context of reducing risks of genetic loss in low-input systems and improving productivity of indigenous breeds. Breeding programmes are proposed to be based on open-nucleus flocks utilizing government ranches at the top of a three tier system of flocks. Such schemes could be used for conservation and improvement of indigenous breeds as well as for crossbreeding.", "year": 2006, "openAccessPdf": null, "authors": [{"authorId": "4884967", "name": "M.

The objective of this study was to estimate heritabilities and genetic correlations for direct and maternal genetic effects using two underlying scales (probit and logit) for lamb survival in order to implement a new procedure of genetic evaluation. Variance components were obtained by Restricted Maximum Likelihood (REML) procedures after transformation of the data using a linear mixed model. Records of survival were from 25,874 lambs born over the period 1989 to 1995 in a prolific Romney flock representing the progeny of 218 sires and 6,771 dams. The model included fixed effects of sex, year, litter size at birth and age of dam and the random effects for direct genetic, maternal genetic and maternal environmental influences. Lambing and survival-to-weaning percentages were 178% and 87%, respectively. The estimates of heritability on the logit scale were 0.01, 0.03 and 0.04 for direct, maternal and total genetic effects, respectively. The proportion of total variance explained by maternal environmental influences was 0.09. The estimated genetic correlation between direct and maternal genetic effects was n0.26. Similar estimates were obtained on the probit scale. Estimates will be lower for the observed scale. These results indicate a greater opportunity for improving survival by manipulating the environment rather than by selection. However survival analysis is an important component of quality assurance in a genetic improvement scheme even if the resultant breeding values are not used for direct selection.", "year": 1999, "openAccessPdf": null, "authors": [{"authorId": "1397369098", "name": "N.

Dickerson (1978) estimated that 56% of the total feed energy intake for adult and market cattle is required solely for body maintenance (the non-productive energy requirement rises to 73% when replacements are considered). He also estimated that increasing reproductive rate from 0.8 to 1.8 could reduce the feed energy required by 25% per kg of edible meat protein. Preliminary experimental results from embryo transfer (Dickerson et al. 1988) and genetic studies (Gregory et al. 1990) show that gains of this order seem possible. The Meat Research Corporation (MRC) has sponsored a co-ordinated project on the application of advanced reproductive technology in temperate zone cattle which has focussed on beef twinning. While twinning has been the subject of a number of reviews (e.g. Hendy and Bowman 1970, Gordon 1983 and Morris 1984), the major stimuli for the current project were the finding that immunisation with ovarian follicular fluid (Cummins et al. 1986) and purified inhibin (Bindon et al. 1988) could stimulate multiple ovulation in cattle and from the development (Lu et al. 1987) and cornmercialisation of in vitro fertilisation and embryo transfer to induce twinning by Ovamass Ltd in Ireland.

Eighty lambs (25 PW sire \u00d7 PW dam, 13 TX \u00d7 TX, 25 TX \u00d7 PW, and 17 PW \u00d7 TX) born to 69 grazing ewes were used. At birth, the log\u2081\u2080 length of the second stage of parturition, birth weight, placental weight, and several body measurements were recorded on all lambs, and jugular blood samples were analyzed with the i-Stat Portable Clinical Analyzer (Abbott, Montevideo, Uruguay). A modified Apgar viability score at birth and lamb behavior during their first hour of life were recorded. Brain weight, muscle:bone ratio, and bone density were recorded in 20 male lambs (5 from each breed group) that were euthanized and dissected 24 h after birth. Data were analyzed by linear regression, least squares ANOVA, and ordinal and binary logistic regressions. Mean blood gas and acid-base variables were 7.21 \u00b1 0.09 for pH, 18.4 \u00b1 9.8 mmHg for partial pressure of oxygen, 53 \u00b1 12.5 mmHg for partial pressure of carbon dioxide, and -4 \u00b1 5.1 mmol/L for extracellular fluid base excess. Parturition duration increased with birth weight (P < 0.001) and was shorter in TX ewes (P < 0.001), female lambs (P < 0.05), twins (P < 0.09), and twin females (sex \u00d7 litter size interaction, P < 0.02). Twenty-six (32.9%) lambs were born asphyxiated (pO\u2082 < 10 mmHg or pH <7.1). Parturition duration increased the risk of asphyxia (P < 0.001), decreased the viability score (P < 0.001), and increased the latency to suckle the udder (P < 0.05). Twin-born lambs presented at birth a 16-fold greater risk of asphyxia (P < 0.01) and reduced placental efficiency (P < 0.05). Texel-sired lambs appeared immature at birth, with less bone density (P < 0.05), smaller brain (P < 0.05), shorter forelimbs (P < 0.05), greater anterior (P < 0.001) and posterior (P < 0.05) neck circumference, and greater muscle:bone ratio (P < 0.05). Immaturity may explain greater TX biotype survival.

Two lines of Merino sheep were divergently selected from the same base population since 1986 on maternal ranking values for multiple rearing ability. In the high (H) line, ewe and ram progeny were preferably descended from ewes that reared >1 lamb per joining. In the low (L) line, replacements were the progeny of ewes that reared 10 s, but H line lambs were quicker (P<0.01) to progress from standing to suckling than L line contemporaries (28 v. 38 min respectively). This line difference remained after adjustment for better co-operation of H line ewes with the first suckling attempts of their progeny. Ewes in the H line tended (P = 0.18) to remain longer on or near their birth sites than L line contemporaries (403 v. 362 min respectively). They also tended to be less ( P = 0.07) likely to desert their lambs than L line ewes (12/424 = 0.028 v. 14/230 = 0.061 respectively). After least-squares adjustment for their heavier ( P<0.01) litter weight, H line ewes experienced shorter ( P<0.05) births than their L line contemporaries (46 v. 57 min respectively). Fewer (P<0.05) H line lambs died during or shortly after parturition (respective proportions of 22/890 = 0.025 and 25/441 = 0.057), while maiden H line ewes were less (P<0.05) likely to be assisted at lambing than L line contemporaries (4/107 = 0.037 v. 8/61 = 0.131 respectively). With regard to overall lamb production, it was found that the number of lambs weaned per ewe present at lambing in the H line was improved (P<0.05) in all years relative to that observed in the L line, the differences ranging from 25% in 1993 to 47% in 1997.

Seven pairs of twin fetuses were studied beginning at 126 \u00b1 1 days gestation (term = 145 days). One twin was given losartan (10 mg \u22c5 kg-1 \u22c5 day-1iv) for 7 consecutive days after PA banding, and the other twin served as a saline-treated, PA-banded control. Four additional pairs of twins served as sham-operated controls. Fetal heart rate (HR) and mean arterial blood pressure (MABP) were similar in the two groups of PA-banded animals before treatment and remained unchanged in the PA-banded control group. Losartan resulted in a significant decrease ( P < 0.05) in MABP between days 0 and 7, whereas HR was not affected. Total body weight of the losartan-treated animals was significantly less ( P < 0.05) than twin PA-banded controls and nonbanded fetuses. Right ventricle weight-to-body weight ratios were similar in saline (2.29 \u00b1 0.34 g/kg) and losartan-treated (2.11 \u00b1 0.15 g/kg) PA-banded animals and significantly greater than that in nonbanded fetuses (1.52 \u00b1 0.07 g/kg). Similar differences were seen in the right ventricle weight-to-left ventricle weight ratios. Right and left ventricle AT1 receptor mRNA and protein expression were also similar among the three groups, as were AT2 receptor mRNA levels. These data suggest that endogenous angiotensin II does not contribute to the development of pressure overload-induced right ventricular hypertrophy during fetal life and that expression of angiotensin receptors is not altered by increased afterload in the ovine fetus.", "year": 1997, "openAccessPdf": null, "authors": [{"authorId": "4896466", "name": "J.

The Booroola gene, an autosomal mutation that affects ovulation rate, has been known for over two decades and despite intensive research it has not yet been identified. Using resources from human genome mapping and known data about gene linkage and chromosome location in the sheep, we selected the gene encoding the Bone Morphogenetic Protein receptor (BMPR) type 1 B (ALK-6) as a candidate site for the mutation. The BMPR1B gene in the human is located at the region linked with the Booroola mutation, syntenic to chromosome 6 in the sheep. A fragment of the sheep BMPR1B gene was cloned from an ovarian cDNA and the deduced aminoacid (AA) sequence is over 98% homologous to the known mammalian sequences. cDNA and genomic DNA from 20 Booroola genotypes were screened and two point mutation were found in the kinase domain of the receptor, one at base 746 of the coding region (A in the ++ to a G in FF animals) which results in a change from a glutamine in the wild type to a arginine in the Booroola animals. Another point mutation was identified at position 1113, (C to A) but this mutation does not change the coding aminoacid. The first mutation was confirmed in genomic DNA from 10 ewes from an independent Brazilian flock which segregates the Booroola phenotype. In all instances homozygous FecB gene carrier (n=11) had only the 746 A to G mutation, non gene carriers (n=14) had only the wild type sequence and heterozygote gene carriers (n=5) had both sequences. This mutation in the subdomain 3 of the kinase domain could result in an alteration in the expression and/or phosphorylation of SMADs, resulting in the phenotype characteristic of the Booroola animals which is the 'precocious' development of a large number of small antral follicles resulting in increased ovulation rate.", "year": 2001, "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://joe.bioscientifica.com/downloadpdf/journals/joe/169/2/R1.pdf", "status": "BRONZE"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2238141980", "name": "CJ Souza"}, {"authorId": "15884076", "name": "C.

Breeding values (BV) for ovulation rate for 33 sires used within the screened flock and ovulation rate deviations for a further 17 sires progeny tested in commercial flocks suggest that a major gene (Woodlands gene) for ovulation rate with a non-Mendelian inheritance pattern is segregating in a family line. Rams assigned as carriers of the putative gene did not produce carrier sons (zero of three), and this coupled with the observation that daughters of carrier rams had ovulation rates of 0.39 (standard error of difference [SED] = 0.06) higher than contemporaries without a significant increase in the variance of log ovulation rate strongly suggests that the gene is on the X chromosome. The evidence suggests that the gene is also maternally imprinted because ovulation rate data indicate that it is expressed where females inherit a paternal allele but is silenced when inherited on a maternal allele. Maternal granddaughters of carrier rams had mean ovulation rates that were only 0.02 (SED = 0.06) higher than noncarrier ewes from the same flock. Furthermore, carrier dams expressing the gene (paternal allele) had 24 sons, none of which had female offspring that expressed the gene, whereas carrier dams not expressing the gene (maternal allele) had 7 out of 17 sons that had female progeny expressing the gene. There is no evidence of the infertility that occurs in homozygous ewes carrying the X-linked Inverdale gene. Collectively, these results suggest the existence of a novel gene for prolificacy located on the X chromosome that is maternally imprinted. The Woodlands gene was only expressed upon paternal inheritance from carrier males that were the progeny of nonexpressing carrier dams. The gene was not expressed in ewes that received it from either carrier dams (expressing or nonexpressing) or from carrier males that were the progeny of expressing carrier dams.", "year": 2001, "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://academic.oup.com/biolreprod/article-pdf/64/1/216/10644398/biolreprod0216.pdf", "status": "BRONZE"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "144478885", "name": "G.

We have investigated the hypothesis that fetal overnutrition results in reduced expression and phosphorylation of the cellular fuel sensor, AMP-activated kinase (AMPK) in liver and skeletal muscle before and after birth. From 115 days gestation, ewes were fed either at or approximately 55% above maintenance energy requirements. Postmortem was performed on lamb fetuses at 139-141 days gestation (n = 14) and lambs at 30 days of postnatal age (n = 21), and liver and quadriceps muscle were collected at each time point. The expression of AMPKalpha1 and AMPKalpha2 mRNA was determined by quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR). The abundance of AMPKalpha and phospho-AMPKalpha (P-AMPKalpha) was determined by Western blot analysis, and the proportion of the total AMPKalpha pool that was phosphorylated in each sample (%P-AMPKalpha) was determined. The ratio of AMPKalpha2 to AMPKalpha1 mRNA expression was lower in fetuses compared with lambs in both liver and muscle, independent of maternal nutrition. Hepatic %P-AMPKalpha was lower in both fetuses and lambs in the Overfed group and %P-AMPKalpha in the lamb liver was inversely related to plasma glucose concentrations in the first 24 h after birth (r = 0.73, P < 0.025). There was no effect of maternal overnutrition on total AMPKalpha or P-AMPKalpha abundance in liver or skeletal muscle. We have, therefore, demonstrated that AMPKalpha responds to signals of increased nutrient availability in the fetal liver.

The genes encoding bone morphogenetic (BM) protein 15 and growth differentiation (GD) factor 9, respectively BMP15 and GDF9 have been shown to affect female productivity in domesticated sheep. Recently, numerous investigations have been performed on a variety of breeds to determine the association between mutations in these genes and fertility. Thus, in this study, we assessed such mutations in the Moghani and Ghezel breeds using polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) with appropriate enzymes. Our data were similar to those of the previous studies showing that the genotypes were heterozygous for GD (G -->A) and BM (C -->T) mutations. These heterozygous genotypes resulted in higher ovulation rates, illustrating that one copy of each of the BMP15 and GDF9 mutations had equivalent effects on the ovulation rate. We demonstrate for the first time that the BM variant may not be sufficient on its own for infertility.

In particular, we have used this technology to study the function of multiple members of the transforming growth factor-beta superfamily including inhibins, activins, and growth differentiation factor 9 (GDF-9 or Gdf9). Knockout mice lacking GDF-9 are infertile due to a block in folliculogenesis at the primary follicle stage. In addition, recombinant GDF-9 regulates multiple cumulus granulosa cell functions in the periovulatory period including hyaluronic acid synthesis and cumulus expansion. We have also cloned an oocyte-specific homolog of GDF-9 from mice and humans, which is termed bone morphogenetic protein 15 (BMP-15 or Bmp15). To define the function of BMP-15 in mice, we generated embryonic stem cells and knockout mice, which have a null mutation in this X-linked gene. Male chimeric and Bmp15 null mice are normal and fertile. In contrast to Bmp15 null males and Gdf9 knockout females, Bmp15 null females (Bmp15(-/-)) are subfertile and usually have minimal ovarian histopathological defects, but demonstrate decreased ovulation and fertilization rates. To further decipher possible direct or indirect genetic interactions between GDF-9 and BMP-15, we have generated double mutant mice lacking one or both alleles of these related homologs. Double homozygote females (Bmp15(-/-)Gdf9(-/-)) display oocyte loss and cysts and resemble Gdf9(-/-) mutants. In contrast, Bmp15(-/-)Gdf9(+/-) female mice have more severe fertility defects than Bmp15(-/-) females, which appear to be due to abnormalities in ovarian folliculogenesis, cumulus cell physiology, and fertilization. Thus, the dosage of intact Bmp15 and Gdf9 alleles directly influences the destiny of the oocyte during folliculogenesis and in the periovulatory period.

In addition to energy, colostrum provides immunoglobulins which ensure passive systemic immunity. Therefore, getting early access to the udder is essential for the neonate. The results from the literature reviewed here highlight the importance of the birth site as the location where the mutual bonding between the mother and her young takes place. Attraction to birth fluids by the periparturient ewe leads to intense licking of the lamb. Grooming not only dries, cleans and stimulates the newborn it also facilitates bonding through learning of its individual odour. Ewes having twins should ideally stay on the birth site for at least six hours in order to establish a strong bond with both lambs and favour lambs survival. However, primiparous ewes or ewes having high levels of emotivity are more likely to exhibit poor maternal behaviour. In addition, difficult parturition and weather conditions have an indirect effect on the behaviour of the mother and are other major causes of lamb death. On the lamb's side, rapid access to the udder and early suckling are extremely important. Delayed lactation or insufficient colostrum yield may be fatal especially since suckling has strong rewarding properties in the establishment of a preference for the mother, which in turn increases lamb survival. Insufficient access to the udder in mothers leaving the birth site too soon after parturition, especially in twin-bearing ewes, could also partly account for the high incidence of loss of mother-young contact and subsequent death in such lambs. Strategies to improve neonatal survival should be aimed at maximising lamb vigour, colostrum production, and mutual mother-young bonding through adequate feeding in late pregnancy and selection on behaviour.", "year": 2006, "openAccessPdf": {"url": "http://rnd.edpsciences.org/articles/rnd/pdf/2006/05/r6409.pdf", "status": "BRONZE"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "144628733", "name": "R.

The objective of this study was to investigate whether neonatal lambs showing slow behavioral progress to standing and sucking also have an impaired ability to maintain body temperature. The time taken to stand and suck after birth, rectal temperatures, and blood samples were collected from 115 newborn single, twin, and triplet lambs of 2 breeds, Scottish Blackface and Suffolk, which are known to show variations in their neonatal behavioral progress. Blood samples were assayed for thyroid hormones, known to be involved in heat production, and cortisol, which plays a role in tissue maturation before birth. In addition, colostrum samples were collected from the 56 ewes that gave birth to the lambs, and assayed for protein, fat, and vitamin contents. Heavy lambs (more than 1 SD above the breed mean), Blackface lambs, and singleton or twin lambs were quicker to stand and suck from their mothers than lightweight (more than 1 SD below the breed mean), Suffolk, or triplet lambs. Low birth weight lambs also had lower rectal temperatures than heavier lambs (P < 0.01), as did Suffolk compared with Blackface lambs (P < 0.001). Lambs that were slow to suck after birth had lower rectal temperatures than quick lambs, and this difference persisted for at least 3 d after birth. Within breed, heavy lambs had greater plasma triiodothyronine and thyroxine immediately after birth than light lambs. Blackface lambs had greater plasma triiodothyronine and thyroxine than Suffolk lambs but tended to have less cortisol. Colostrum produced by Blackface ewes had a greater fat content than that of Suffolk ewes (P < 0.001). Thus, lambs that are behaviorally slow at birth are also less able to maintain their body temperature after birth.

We investigate factors influencing the trade-off between survival and reproduction in female Soay sheep (Ovis aries).

The cost is identified as a quadratic function of age, being greatest for females breeding at 1 year of age and when more than 7 years old. Costs, however, were only present during severe environmental conditions (wet and stormy winters occurring when population density was high). 3. Winter severity and population size explain most of the variation in the probability of breeding for the first time at 1 year of life, but did not affect the subsequent breeding probability. 4. The presence of a cost of reproduction was confirmed by an experiment where a subset of females was prevented from breeding in their first year of life. 5. Our results suggest that breeding decisions are quality or condition dependent.

As a general trend, mother-young interactions vary according to the maturity of the newborn, and the size of the litter. Neonatal survival relies to a great extent on an environment that is ecologically appropriate for the developmental stage of the neonate, and on optimum interactions with the mother. Adaptive maternal care supposes that the mother provides the basic needs of the neonate: warmth (in pigs and rabbits) or shelter, food, water and immunological protection (via colostrum) and, in some instances, protection from predators and other conspecifics. A major risk facing all neonates, other than the birth process itself, is inadequate colostrum intake owing to delayed suckling or competition with siblings, which leads to starvation, hypothermia or even crushing, as has been observed in pigs.", "year": 2000, "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://rep.bioscientifica.com/downloadpdf/journals/revreprod/5/3/153.pdf", "status": "BRONZE"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2254694171", "name": "Raymond Nowak"}, {"authorId": "2262597499", "name": "Richard H.

The aim of this research was to quantify the separate effects of age and liveweight at the start of breeding on the components of weaning rate. The analysis of data from more than 11,500 maternal composite ewe lambs indicated that ewe lambs that were heavier at the start of the breeding period weaned more offspring than lighter ewes, but if ewe lambs reached 45 kg their weaning rate was within 5% of their maximum for a given age. By contrast, the effects of age at breeding on weaning rate was linear and increased by 0.4% per day. Within the range from 35 to 45 kg liveweight and 6 to 9 months of age, a 1-kg increase in the liveweight at the start of breeding had the equivalent effect on weaning rate as an extra 7 days of age at the start of breeding. This understanding of the trade-off between age and liveweight at breeding will assist farmers to optimize the management and reproductive performance of ewe lambs. Abstract In this paper, we tested the hypothesis that ewe lambs that are heavier and older at breeding will wean more offspring, due to increased reproductive rate and offspring survival and lower maternal mortality. To test this hypothesis, we analyzed data from more than 11,500 maternal composite ewe lambs collected over eight years. The ewe lambs had full pedigree records including birth type, age and liveweight at breeding plus records of the birthweight and survival of their offspring and the dam. The average liveweight and age at breeding was 40.2 kg and 228 days. The reproductive rate and weaning rate responses to liveweight at breeding were curvilinear (p < 0.001), and if ewe lambs achieved 45 kg by the start of breeding, their reproductive rate and weaning rate were within 5% of their maximum. By contrast, the effects of age at breeding on weaning rate was linear and increased by 0.4% per day, despite a quadratic (p < 0.01) effect of age at breeding on reproductive rate which increased only marginally when ewe lambs were older than 8 months at breeding. Increasing liveweight (p < 0.05) or age (p < 0.001) at breeding increased survival of their offspring, however an extra 10 kg of liveweight or 30 days of age at breeding increased offspring survival by less than 5%. Both liveweight (p < 0.001) and age (p < 0.01) at breeding also influenced survival of the ewe lamb dam but survival rates exceeded 95% across the range in liveweights from 30 to 55 kg and ages from 6 to 9 months. This understanding of the trade-off between age and liveweight at breeding will assist farmers to optimize the management of their ewe lambs, given the earlier they can be bred successfully the easier they can be integrated with the breeding of the adult ewe flock the following year.", "year": 2021, "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://www.mdpi.com/2076-2615/11/9/2733/pdf?version=1632376356", "status": "GOLD"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2117429360", "name": "A.

In association with their own (status 1) calf, each double-suckled cow fostered a Friesian male (status 2) calf during the post-partum housing period. Calf live weights, milk intakes, and daylight grazing times and suckling activities were recorded. Single-suckled calves were significantly heavier at weaning (221 and 209 kg) than either status 1 (185 and 170 kg) or status 2 (180 and 175 kg) double-suckled calves in experiments 1 and 2 respectively. Daily gains of the single- and status 1 and 2 double-suckled calves were 0\u00b787, 0\u00b769 and 0\u00b761 kg/day in experiment 1, and 0\u00b794, 0\u00b772 and 0\u00b770 kg/day in experiment 2. Single-suckled calves consumed significantly more milk per day during three 28- day periods at pasture than did either status 1 or status 2 double-suckled calves (7\u00b79, 5\u00b72 and 50kg/day, and 90, 7\u00b72 and 6\u00b75 kg/day in experiments 1 and 2). Status effects in the double-suckled calves were not significant for live weights, weight gains or milk intakes. Double-suckled calves spent more time grazing and sucked their own or assigned foster dams less frequently than did single-suckled calves. Status 2 double-suckled calves spent more time grazing (experiment 1) and sucked for significantly shorter periods from more foreign dams than did their status 1 contemporaries. It was concluded that double suckling increased annual total weight of calf output per cow but that it was achieved at the expense of individual calf growth performance. Reduced milk intake appeared to be a major factor in limiting live-weight gains in the double-suckled calves.", "year": 1982, "openAccessPdf": null, "authors": [{"authorId": "97604160", "name": "G.

Obesity adversely alters renal and adipose tissue function, resulting in chronic kidney disease and insulin resistance, respectively, the latter associated with dysregulation of the unfolded protein response (UPR). In view of the current obesity epidemic, we explored the combined effects of in utero early\u2010 to midgestational nutrient restriction and postnatal obesity on the UPR in ovine juvenile offspring. Nutrient restriction was coincident with fetal kidney development but prior to exponential adipose tissue deposition. Nutrient restricted (NR) and normal diet (control) offspring were exposed to an obesogenic environment throughout adolescence, resulting in similar degrees of juvenile obesity. NR offspring showed enhanced adipose tissue dysregulation characterized by activation of the UPR, perturbed insulin signaling, and marked inflammation, as demonstrated by increased abundance of crownlike structures and proinflammatory genes. Conversely, in renal tissue NR offspring had marked attenuation of cellular stress and inflammation evident as reduced activation of the UPR, down\u2010regulation of proinflammatory genes, and less histological damage. In conclusion, obesity\u2010related activation of the UPR can be determined by the in utero nutritional environment, demonstrating organ\u2010specific effects dependent on the developmental phase targeted within the fetus.\u2014 Sharkey, D., Gardner, D.

In the Lacaune sheep breed, large variation in litter size is genetically determined by the segregation of a fecundity major gene influencing ovulation rate, named FecL and its prolific allele FecLL. Our previous work localized FecL on sheep chromosome 11 within a locus of 1.1 Mb encompassing 20 genes. With the aim to identify the FecL gene, we developed a high throughput sequencing strategy of long-range PCR fragments spanning the locus of FecLL carrier and non-carrier ewes. Resulting informative markers defined a new 194.6 kb minimal interval. The reduced FecL locus contained only two genes, insulin-like growth factor 2 mRNA binding protein 1 (IGF2BP1) and beta-1,4-N-acetyl-galactosaminyl transferase 2 (B4GALNT2), and we identified two SNP in complete linkage disequilibrium with FecLL. B4GALNT2 appeared as the best positional and expressional candidate for FecL, since it showed an ectopic expression in the ovarian follicles of FecLL/FecLL ewes at mRNA and protein levels. In FecLL carrier ewes only, B4GALNT2 transferase activity was localized in granulosa cells and specifically glycosylated proteins were detected in granulosa cell extracts and follicular fluids. The identification of these glycoproteins by mass spectrometry revealed at least 10 proteins, including inhibin alpha and betaA subunits, as potential targets of B4GALNT2 activity. Specific ovarian protein glycosylation by B4GALNT2 is proposed as a new mechanism of ovulation rate regulation in sheep, and could contribute to open new fields of investigation to understand female infertility pathogenesis.", "year": 2013, "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article/file?id=10.1371/journal.pgen.1003809&type=printable", "status": "GOLD"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "5259182", "name": "L.

A specific, high-affinity antibody was generated against recombinant ovine leptin which, when used in a competitive leptin RIA, provided valid estimates of linearity (r=+0.989-0.998), recovery (102%), repeatability (13%) and limit of sensitivity (0.83 ng/ml for 100 microl sample size). Serial dilutions of five ovine, bovine or caprine plasma samples showed good linearity and parallelism with the recombinant ovine leptin standard curve. A comparison of this RIA was made with a commercial 'multi-species' RIA kit using 56 ovine plasma samples. Major differences were found in assay sensitivity. Non-lactating, non-pregnant, ovariectomized ewes were fed a ration for 65 days which provided 90+/-9% (control; n=12) or 39+/-2% of maintenance energy requirements (underfed; n=16) in order to analyse the respective effects of body fatness (estimated by either an in vivo dilution technique or body condition scoring) and of nutritional status on plasma leptin concentration. There was a significant positive correlation between body fatness or body condition score and plasma leptin levels (r=+0.68, P<0.001 or r=+0.72, P<0.001 respectively). When concentrations of leptin were assessed over time, underfed ewes exhibited a dramatic reduction in plasma leptin values (-56%, P<0.001).

This study determined whether these impacts of nutrition of the ewe on ewe and progeny performance are measurable on commercial properties across southern Australia at a paddock-scale where ewes were aggregated into flocks with a greater spread of the date of conception and where the liveweight profile of the flocks were managed based on random samples of 100 ewes and liveweight was uncorrected for fleece weight or conceptus. Eighteen paddock-scale experiments at 15 sites were conducted in cooperation with wool producers across Victoria, Western Australia, New South Wales, South Australia, and Tasmania. Each co-operator joined up to 1000 mixed aged adult Merino ewes. The flock was scanned using ultrasound at Day 50 from the start of joining to identify those ewes that conceived during the first 21 days of joining. These ewes were then split at random into two treatments and fed to achieve a target difference in liveweight of 10 kg or ~1 condition score/fat score at lambing. The production of ewes during their year of pregnancy and following their next joining was measured as was the performance of their progeny up to their third shearing. Only the 13 paddock-scale experiments that achieved a difference in liveweight profile at lambing of at least 4 kg were included in the final analysis. In these 13 experiments, increasing the nutrition of Merino ewes during pregnancy clearly increased the clean fleece weight and fibre diameter in ewes and the survival and lifetime wool production of their lambs. In most cases the size of the effect was not significantly different to that predicted by the relationship derived using individual liveweight profiles in the plot-scale experiments. This confirms that managing average ewe liveweight or condition score/fat score profile through better nutrition will lead to predictable increases in the performance of ewes and their progeny performance under commercial conditions and validates the use of the plot-scale relationships in economic analyses.", "year": 2011, "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://www.publish.csiro.au/an/pdf/AN10183", "status": "HYBRID"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "88432589", "name": "R.

The hypothesis that the survival and productivity of single- and twin-born progeny is not affected by differential management of single- and twin-bearing ewes was tested. To test this hypothesis, two ewe flocks were monitored on a commercial property in the south-east of South Australia. The body condition score of one flock of ewes was managed according to Lifetimewool recommendations for southern Australian (Lifetimewool flock; n = 464). Lifetimewool recommendations are that body condition score should be 3.0 at mating and then allowed to decline to an average of 2.7, which is maintained until lambing. Twin- and single-bearing ewes were managed as separate mobs after pregnancy scanning to meet their energy requirements. The second flock was managed similarly to the commercial ewe flock and was representative of ewe management practices in the region (normal-practice flock; n = 464). At lambing, the condition score of the Lifetimewool flock was 0.7 condition scores units greater than the normal-practice flock. Ewe clean fleece weight and fibre diameter were greater in the Lifetimewool flock and their lambs had higher survival rates to weaning. Over three shearings, progeny from Lifetimewool ewe flocks produced more clean wool (P < 0.0001) but there was no consistent effect on fibre diameter, staple length or staple strength. Twin-born lambs from ewes managed to Lifetimewool guidelines had a similar liveweight and produced similar quantity and quality of wool to single-born lambs managed to Lifetimewool guidelines, but still suffered higher rates of mortality to weaning. This suggests that it is possible to manage ewes pregnant with twins to ensure that their surviving progeny perform at a level similar to single-born progeny managed under similar targets.", "year": 2011, "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://www.publish.csiro.au/an/pdf/AN09158", "status": "HYBRID"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "47018492", "name": "J.

Fetal growth and birthweight are regulated by genotype of the fetus, maternal genotype, maternal nutrition and the external environment. In this paper we report the extent to which the changes in maternal liveweight during pregnancy and lactation (liveweight profile) of Merino ewes can be used to predict the birthweight and survival of their progeny to weaning. At two sites [Victoria (Vic.) ~700 ewes and Western Australia (WA) ~300 ewes] in each of 2 years, a similar experiment used adult Merino ewes to explore effects of nutrition from joining to Day 100 of pregnancy and from Day 100 of pregnancy to weaning. The average difference between extreme treatments at Day 100 of pregnancy were 7 kg in ewe liveweight and 0.7 of a condition score (CS) and at lambing 11.9 kg and 1.3 of a CS. This resulted in average birthweights of progeny from different treatments ranging from 4.0 to 5.4 kg and survival to weaning ranging from 68 to 92%. Across the four experiments between 68 and 85% of all lamb deaths to weaning occurred within 48 h of birth. Lambs born to ewes in CS 2 at Day 100 of pregnancy were lighter (P < 0.05) in both years at the Vic. site than those from ewes in CS 3 at Day 100 of pregnancy. Lambs born to the ewes grazing a feed on offer of 800 kg DM/ha during late pregnancy were also lighter than those from other levels of feed on offer between 1100 and 3000 kg DM/ha at the Vic. site in both years and at the WA site in 1 year (P < 0.001). Lambs from the 800 kg DM/ha treatment during late pregnancy at the Vic. site had a lower survival than other treatments, especially in the second year. There were no significant effects of treatments on lamb survival at the WA site; however, the results were in the same direction. The birthweight of individual lambs was significantly related to the liveweight profile of their mothers. Their liveweight at joining, change in liveweight to Day 100 of pregnancy and change in liveweight from Day 100 to lambing all contributed (P < 0.05) to the prediction of the birthweight of their lambs. The responses were consistent across experimental sites and years, lamb birth rank and sex, and confirmed that the effects of poor nutrition up until Day 100 of pregnancy could be completely overcome by improving nutrition during late pregnancy. At the Vic. site, survival to 48 h was most influenced by the birthweight of the lamb and survival was significantly higher in single- than twin-born lambs and female than male lambs after adjusting for differences in birthweight. A higher chill index during the 48 h after birth reduced survival of both single and twin lambs to a similar extent, but reduced survival of male lambs more than female lambs. There were no effects of birthweight or chill index on lamb survival at the WA site where most lambs weighed more than 4 kg at birth and climatic conditions during lambing were less extreme. Overall, these results supported our hypothesis that improving the nutrition of Merino ewes during pregnancy increases birthweight and this leads to improved survival of their progeny.", "year": 2011, "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://www.publish.csiro.au/an/pdf/AN10155", "status": "HYBRID"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "145765005", "name": "C.

In this paper we used bio-economic modelling to develop optimum liveweight1 profiles for spring-lambing Merino ewes in different environments. The modelling included the impacts of the ewe liveweight profile on the production of the ewe and the survival and lifetime wool production of her progeny. Fifteen ewe liveweight profiles were analysed for each region to determine the profitability of varying ewe liveweight at joining, varying rate of loss of liveweight after joining and the rate of gain in liveweight from the minimum to lambing. The analyses support the hypotheses that whole-farm profitability is sensitive to the liveweight profile of Merino ewe flocks and that there is a liveweight profile that maximises whole-farm profit. The variation between the most and least profitable ewe liveweight profile was $69\u20090002 per farm ($14.30/ewe) for south-west Victoria, $51\u2009000 per farm ($8.70/ewe) for Great Southern Western Australia and $33\u2009300 per farm ($9.70/ewe) for southern New South Wales. The changes in profit were due to differences in costs of feeding to achieve the ewe liveweight profile and its influence on the production of both the ewes and their progeny. Failure to include the impacts of liveweight profile on progeny survival and lifetime wool production incorrectly identifies the optimum ewe liveweight profile and provided inaccurate estimates of profitability. The optimum liveweight profiles for ewes lambing in spring were similar for all three regions and insensitive to changing commodity prices, pasture productivity and management. The optimum profile was to join ewes at ~90% of the standard reference weight of the genotype, lose a small amount of weight after joining and regain weight in late pregnancy to return to the joining weight by lambing. Regaining the liveweight lost in early pregnancy by lambing is the most important target to achieve. The cost per farm of missing this liveweight target by 1 kg was $13\u2009000 ($2.60/ewe) for south-west Victoria, $8900 ($1.45/ewe) for Great Southern Western Australia and $5500 ($1.65/ewe) for southern New South Wales. By contrast, the cost per farm of missing the joining target by 1 kg was $5500 for south-west Victoria and less than $2000 across the other two regions. Whole-farm profit increased with increasing stocking rate up to an optimum and regardless of stocking rate there is an additional opportunity to increase whole-farm profit by up to 15% by managing ewes to achieve the optimum liveweight profile. This indicates that the optimum liveweight profile should be achieved by increasing the level of grain feeding and altering the timing of utilising the farm feed resources rather than manipulating stocking rate.", "year": 2011, "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://www.publish.csiro.au/an/pdf/AN10078", "status": "HYBRID"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2107729297", "name": "J.

Ninety\u2010six twin\u2010 and 90 triplet\u2010bearing Romney ewes were randomly assigned on P64 to four replicated sward height treatments (2, 4, 6, and 8 cm sward height). Within 24\u201336 h of parturition (L1) the ewes were reassigned to two (4 and 8 cm) replicated sward heights until weaning at L87. Ewes grazing the 2 cm sward height during pregnancy were significantly (P < 0.01) lighter at P99 and P132 and at L1 than ewes grazing 4, 6 or 8 cm swards. These ewes also had significantly (P < 0.01) lower dry matter intakes, condition scores, and ultrasonic backfat depths. Litter size had no effect on ewe intake, ewe liveweight or condition score throughout pregnancy and lactation. Ewes grazing the 2 cm sward height had significantly (P < 0.05) lower dry matter intakes during pregnancy than ewes on the 4, 6, and 8 cm treatments. Estimated herbage dry matter intakes measured using n\u2010alkanes were similar to calculated energy requirements. Lambs born to ewes grazing the 2 cm swards during pregnancy were lightest at birth (P < 0.01), but sward height during pregnancy or lactation had no effect on lamb weaning weight or lamb survival rate to weaning. Triplet\u2010born lambs were 0.9 kg lighter (P < 0.05) than twins at birth, with the difference increasing in those lambs reared as a full triplet set to 4.7 kg at L87. Lamb losses were 14% in twin\u2010born lambs and 32% in triplet\u2010born lambs. There was no sward height by litter size interaction for ewe liveweight, intake or lamb birth and weaning weight or survival, therefore the results suggest ewes rearing either twins or triplets should be fed sward height allowances of 4 cm or better during pregnancy.

Major genes increasing litter size (LS) and ovulation rate (OR) were suspected in the French Grivette and the Polish Olkuska sheep populations, respectively. To identify genetic variants responsible for the highly prolific phenotype in these two breeds, genome-wide association studies (GWAS) followed by complementary genetic and functional analyses were performed. Highly prolific ewes (cases) and normal prolific ewes (controls) from each breed were genotyped using the Illumina OvineSNP50 Genotyping Beadchip. In both populations, an X chromosome region, close to the BMP15 gene, harbored clusters of markers with suggestive evidence of association at significance levels between 1E\u221205 and 1E\u221207. The BMP15 candidate gene was then sequenced, and two novel non-conservative mutations called FecXGr and FecXO were identified in the Grivette and Olkuska breeds, respectively. The two mutations were associated with the highly prolific phenotype (pFecXGr\u200a=\u200a5.98E\u221206 and pFecXO\u200a=\u200a2.55E\u221208). Homozygous ewes for the mutated allele showed a significantly increased prolificacy (FecXGr/FecXGr, LS\u200a=\u200a2.50\u00b10.65 versus FecX+/FecXGr, LS\u200a=\u200a1.93\u00b10.42, p<1E\u221203 and FecXO/FecXO, OR\u200a=\u200a3.28\u00b10.85 versus FecX+/FecXO, OR\u200a=\u200a2.02\u00b10.47, p<1E\u221203). Both mutations are located in very well conserved motifs of the protein and altered the BMP15 signaling activity in vitro using a BMP-responsive luciferase test in COV434 granulosa cells. Thus, we have identified two novel mutations in the BMP15 gene associated with increased LS and OR. Notably, homozygous FecXGr/FecXGr Grivette and homozygous FecXO/FecXO Olkuska ewes are hyperprolific in striking contrast with the sterility exhibited by all other known homozygous BMP15 mutations.

The aim of this research was to extend in vitro results from the rodent to sheep and cattle and, using both in vivo and in vitro models, to identify factors that can enhance or attenuate the action of gonadotrophins in stimulating follicle development. Using sheep with ovarian autotransplants, we have obtained evidence to show that a number of factors inhibit ovarian function in vivo, whereas only insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) has a stimulatory effect. Further study of the mechanism of action of these factors at a cellular level has been made possible by the development of a serum-free granulosa cell culture system for both sheep and cattle that allows induction and maintenance of oestradiol production. Using this model system, we have confirmed many of the results from out studies in vivo and have shown that IGF-I and insulin interact at physiological concentrations to influence both cellular proliferation and oestradiol production.

Follicular dominance is the mechanism by which the selected follicle(s) undergoes rapid development in an environment where growth and development of other follicles, recruited at a similar time, are suppressed. These processes are controlled by the interaction of endocrine signals and locally produced ovarian growth factors. The response of the two major follicular cell types, granulosa and theca cells, to gonadotrophins is regulated by the local production of growth factors. Mechanisms controlling growth factor action occupy a central role in the regulation of folliculogenesis. In this review, we highlight the influence of the extracellular matrix in this process by describing its involvement in regulating the activity of components of the insulin-like growth factor system, transforming growth factor beta superfamily, fibroblast growth factors and the epidermal growth factor/transforming growth factor alpha family.

Fetal growth restriction reduces neonatal survival, has a permanent stunting effect on postnatal growth and the efficiency of feed/forage utilization in offspring, negatively affects whole body composition and meat quality, and impairs long-term health and athletic performance. Knowledge of the underlying mechanisms has important implications for the prevention of IUGR and is crucial for enhancing the efficiency of livestock production and animal health. Fetal growth within the uterus is a complex biological event influenced by genetic, epigenetic, and environmental factors, as well as maternal maturity. These factors impact on the size and functional capacity of the placenta, uteroplacental blood flows, transfer of nutrients and oxygen from mother to fetus, conceptus nutrient availability, the endocrine milieu, and metabolic pathways. Alterations in fetal nutrition and endocrine status may result in developmental adaptations that permanently change the structure, physiology, metabolism, and postnatal growth of the offspring. Impaired placental syntheses of nitric oxide (a major vasodilator and angiogenic factor) and polyamines (key regulators of DNA and protein synthesis) may provide a unified explanation for the etiology of IUGR in response to maternal undernutrition and overnutrition. There is growing evidence that maternal nutritional status can alter the epigenetic state (stable alterations of gene expression through DNA methylation and histone modifications) of the fetal genome. This may provide a molecular mechanism for the role of maternal nutrition on fetal programming and genomic imprinting.

This study examines the effect of chronic cold exposure during pregnancy, induced by winter shearing twin\u2010bearing ewes 4 weeks before predicted lambing date, on O2 consumption and CO2 production during non\u2010rapid\u2010eye\u2010movement (REM) sleep in lambs maintained for at least 1 h at warm (28\u201018 degrees C) and cold (14\u20105 degrees C) ambient temperatures at 1, 4, 14 and 30 days of age. This was combined with measurement of the thermogenic activity (GDP binding to uncoupling protein in mitochondrial preparations) of perirenal adipose tissue from lambs immediately after birth and at 33 days of age. 2. Lambs born from shorn (cold\u2010exposed) ewes were 15% heavier (P < 0.01) and possessed 21% (P < 0.01) more perirenal adipose tissue that contained 40% more protein and mitochondrial protein than unshorn (P < 0.05) controls. Total GDP binding in perirenal adipose tissue was 40% greater (P < 0.05) in lambs born from shorn ewes but there was no difference in lipid content of this tissue between the two groups. 3. At 1 day of age, lambs born from shorn ewes exhibited a 16% higher (P < 0.05) rate of O2 consumption (per kilogram bodyweight) at the warm temperature and a 40% greater metabolic response to the cold ambient temperature. All lambs born from shorn ewes responded to cold exposure without shivering (i.e. via non\u2010shivering thermogenesis) whilst shivering was measured in four out of seven lambs in the unshorn group. These differences had disappeared by 4 days of age as a result of a 25% increased (P < 0.01) rate of O2 consumption in the warm in lambs born from unshorn ewes and a 20% decrease (P < 0.05) in the response to the cold in lambs from shorn ewes. Shivering during cold exposure was measured in six out of nine lambs born from shorn ewes indicating a rapid alteration in thermoregulatory responses to cold during the first few days of life. 4. The levels of GDP binding and mitochondrial protein in perirenal adipose tissue fell by one\u2010third in both groups of lambs during the first 33 days of life whereas lipid content either increased or was unchanged.

A total of 5274 monthly weight records from birth up to 180 days of age from 889 lambs, collected during 2001 to 2004 in Betecoucou breeding farm in Benin were used. In the preliminary analysis, the General Linear Model Procedure of the Statistical Analysis Systems Institute was applied to the dataset to identify the significant effects of the sex of lamb (male and female), type of birth (single and twin), season of birth (rainy season and dry season), parity of dam (1, 2 and 3) and year of birth (2001, 2002, 2003 and 2004) on the observed birth weight and monthly weight up to 6 months of age. The models parameters (A, B and k), coefficient of determination (R2), mean square error (MSE) were calculated using language of technical computing package Matlab\u00ae, 2006. The mean values of A, B and k were substituted into each model to calculate the corresponding Akaike's Information Criterion (AIC). Among the four growth functions, the Brody model has been selected for its accuracy of fit according to the higher R2, lower MSE and AIC. Finally, the parameters A, B and k were adjusted in Matlab\u00ae, 2006 for the sex of lamb, year of birth, season of birth, birth type and the parity of ewe, providing a specific slope of the Brody growth curve.

METHODS: Romney ewes (n=435) which conceived within a 17-day mating period and successfully gave birth to and reared twin lambs to weaning were used. Ewes were managed during pregnancy so that their total liveweight increased at a level equivalent to the expected growth of the conceptuses. Approximately half of the ewes were shorn 70 days after the mid-point of mating, and the remainder were left unshorn, at which time they had 6-months' wool growth. All lambs were weighed within 12 h of birth and again at weaning. RESULTS: There was a significant linear relationship (R2=0.99) between mean group liveweight and condition score of ewes at mating (difference of 7.3 kg per 1.0 unit condition score). Liveweight of ewes at mating had small but significant (p<0.05) positive effects on both birthweights and growth rates of twin lambs to weaning. Ewes that had condition scores of 3.5\u20134.0 (scale 0\u20135) at mating gave birth to significantly (p<0.05) lighter lambs than ewes that had condition scores <3.5. The condition score of ewes at mating was positively associated with growth rates of lambs, although this effect was largely explained by variation in the liveweight of ewes at mating. Twin lambs born to ewes shorn mid-pregnancy were significantly (p<0.05) heavier at birth (by 0.4 kg) and at weaning (p<0.05) than those born to unshorn ewes. The heavier weaning weights of lambs born to ewes shorn mid-pregnancy were due to a heavier birthweights rather than increased growth rate. CONCLUSIONS: Liveweight and condition score of ewes at mating had small positive effects on growth rates to weaning of twin lambs. Shearing mid-pregnancy increased birthweights and weaning weights of twin lambs. To achieve high weaning weights of twin lambs, farmers should ensure ewes attain high liveweights and condition scores at mating and shear mid-pregnancy. It is speculated that the effects of liveweight and condition score of ewes at mating on weaning weights of twin lambs would be greater than those observed in the present study under conditions in which nutrition of the dam is below optimum.", "year": 2004, "openAccessPdf": null, "authors": [{"authorId": "2069266451", "name": "P.

The synergistic effect of oBMP15 and oGDF9 was almost completely blocked by antibodies generated against these growth factors when administered either alone or in combination. While neither GDF9 (murine or ovine) nor oBMP15 were able to modulate FSH-stimulated progesterone production on their own, FSH-stimulated progesterone production by granulosa cells was potently inhibited when BMP15 and GDF9 were administered together. Immunoreactive alpha-inhibin levels increased more than 15-fold from granulosa cells when BMP15 and GDF9 were given together whereas consistent stimulatory effects of either growth factor alone were not observed. The effects of GDF9 and BMP15, when added together, were different than those observed for the growth factors alone.

It is a heterogeneous disorder that, in the most severe forms, is a result of ovarian dysgenesis (OD). Most OD cases are associated with major X-chromosome abnormalities, but the pathogenesis of this disorder is still largely undefined in patients with a normal karyotype. Animal models showed the important role in female reproduction played by the product of a gene located at Xp11.2 in humans (BMP15). BMP15 is an oocyte-specific growth/differentiation factor that stimulates folliculogenesis and granulosa cell (GC) growth. We report two sisters with a normal karyotype who are affected with hypergonadotropic ovarian failure due to OD. The familial presentation suggested a genetic origin, and candidate genes were screened for mutations. A heterozygous nonconservative substitution in the pro region of BMP15 (Y235C) was identified in both sisters but not in 210 control alleles. This mutation was inherited from the father. Mutant BMP15 appears to be processed abnormally, is associated with reduced GC growth, and antagonizes the stimulatory activity of wild-type protein on GC proliferation. In conclusion, the first natural mutation in human BMP15 is associated with familial OD, indicating that the action of BMP15 is required for the progression of human folliculogenesis. This condition represents an exceptional example of X-linked human disease exclusively affecting heterozygous females who inherited the genetic alteration from the unaffected father.

Likewise, the identities of oocyte-derived secreted factors, which regulate important oocyte-somatic cell interactions, remain largely unknown. For example, oocytes are known to secrete paracrine growth factor(s) which are necessary for cumulus expansion, induction of hyaluronic acid synthesis, and suppression of LH receptor (LHR) mRNA synthesis. Our previous studies demonstrated that absence of the TGF-beta family member, growth differentiation factor-9 (GDF-9), blocks ovarian folliculogenesis at the primary follicle stage leading to infertility. In the present study, we demonstrate that mouse GDF-9 protein is expressed in all oocytes beginning at the type 3a follicle stage including antral follicles. To explore the biological functions of GDF-9 in the later stages of folliculogenesis and cumulus expansion, we produced mature, glycosylated, recombinant mouse GDF-9 using a Chinese hamster ovary cell expression system. A granulosa cell culture system was established to determine the role of GDF-9 in the regulation of several key ovarian gene products using semiquantitative RT-PCR. We find that recombinant GDF-9 induces hyaluronan synthase 2 (HAS2), cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2), and steroidogenic acute regulator protein (StAR) mRNA synthesis but suppresses urokinase plasminogen activator (uPA) and LHR mRNA synthesis. Consistent with the induction of StAR mRNA by GDF-9, recombinant GDF-9 increases granulosa cell progesterone synthesis in the absence of FSH. Since induction of HAS2 and suppression of the protease uPA in cumulus cells are key events in the production of the hyaluronic acid-rich extracellular matrix which is produced during cumulus expansion, we determined whether GDF-9 could mimic this process. Using oocytectomized cumulus cell-oocyte complexes, we show that recombinant GDF-9 induces cumulus expansion in vitro. These studies demonstrate that GDF-9 can bind to receptors on granulosa cells to regulate the expression of a number of gene products. Thus, in addition to playing a critical function as a growth and differentiation factor during early folliculogenesis, GDF-9 functions as an oocyte-secreted paracrine factor to regulate several key granulosa cell enzymes involved in cumulus expansion and maintenance of an optimal oocyte microenvironment, processes which are essential for normal ovulation, fertilization, and female reproduction.", "year": 1999, "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://academic.oup.com/mend/article-pdf/13/6/1035/10715663/mend1035.pdf", "status": "BRONZE"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2243805501", "name": "Julia A.

Purposive and random sampling was employed as sampling technique. Detailed structured questionnaires, focus group discussions, field observations of animals, body measurements, and secondary data collection were employed to produce the data. Body weight, linear body measurements, and qualitative records were taken and observed from 762 Bonga sheep and 816 Horro sheep. For the analyses of quantitative data, the main effects of breed and dentition were fitted to the model within each sex groups. Results revealed that the mean flock sizes for Adiyo Kaka and Horro districts were 11.28 \u00b1 1.27and 8.20 \u00b1 2.05, respectively. Sheep have multi-purpose roles in both production systems. Among the reasons for keeping sheep, source of income was ranked highest. Age at first lambing for Bonga and Horro sheep was 14.9 \u00b1 3.1 and 13.3 \u00b1 1.7 months, respectively. Average lambing intervals were 8.9 \u00b1 2.1 and 9.2 \u00b1 2.4 months, for Bonga and Horro, respectively. Disease, feed shortage, and predators were the most pertinent constraints for sheep production in that order for farmers in Horro. In Adiyo Kaka, disease, labor shortage, predators were ranked as first, second and third based upon their significant influence on sheep productivity. The mean body weight, body length, chest girth, wither height, tail circumference and tail length for Bonga females were 31.87 \u00b1 0.19kg, 69.16 \u00b1 0.15 cm, 72.92 \u00b1 0.17cm, 68.12 \u00b1 0.14cm, 15.92 \u00b1 0.30 cm and 32.07 \u00b1 0.37 cm, respectively.

On the contrary, Bonga ewe\u2019s had significantly (P<0.01) higher values than Horro with respect to body weight, body length, chest width, pelvic width and ear length. Horro male had higher values (P< 0.01) for chest girth; wither height and scrotal circumference than Bonga males. With the exceptions of ear length, tail circumference, tail length and body condition score, within the range of age studied, age was found to have a significant influence (P< 0.01) on most body measurements in females.

For dataset one (Study 1; n=154 Blue-faced Leicester x Swaledale (Mule) and 87 Welsh Mountain ewes, 315 separate cases of birth weight), lamb birth weight as the outcome measure was related to maternal characteristics and individual energy intake of the ewe during specified periods of gestation, i.e. early (1-30 days; term ~147 days gestation), mid (31-80 days) or late (110-147 days) pregnancy. For dataset two (Study 2; n=856 Mule ewes and 5821 cases of birth weight), we investigated using multilevel modelling the influence of ewe weight, parity, barrenness, lamb sex, litter size, lamb mortality and year of birth on lamb birth weight. For a subset of these ewes (n=283), the effect of the ewes' own birth weight was also examined. Interactions between combinations of variables were selectively investigated. Litter size, as expected, had the single greatest influence on birth weight with other significant effects being year of birth, maternal birth weight, maternal nutrition, sex of the lamb, ewe barrenness and maternal body composition at mating.

Skeletal muscle growth and development.", "abstract": "This study investigated effects of birth weight and postnatal nutrition on growth and development of skeletal muscles in neonatal lambs. Low (L; mean +/- SD 2.289 +/- .341 kg, n = 28) and high (H; 4.840 +/- .446 kg, n = 20) birth weight male Suffolk x (Finnsheep x Dorset) lambs were individually reared on a liquid diet to grow rapidly (ad libitum fed, ADG 337 g, n = 20) or slowly (ADG 150 g, n = 20) from birth to live weights (LW) up to approximately 20 kg. At birth, weight of semitendinosus (ST) muscle in L lambs was 43% that in H lambs; aggregate weights of ST and seven other dissected muscles were similarly reduced. In ST muscle of L lambs, mass of DNA, RNA, and protein were also significantly reduced to levels 67, 60, and 34%, respectively, of those in H lambs. However, myofiber numbers of ST, tibialis caudalis, or soleus muscles did not differ between the L and H birth weight lambs and did not change during postnatal growth. During postnatal rearing, daily accretion rate of dissected muscle was lower in L than in H lambs. Accretion of muscle per kilogram of gain in empty body weight (EBW) was reduced in the slowly grown L lambs compared with their H counterparts, although the difference was less pronounced between the rapidly grown L and H lambs. Throughout the postnatal growth period, ST muscle of L lambs contained less DNA with a higher protein:DNA ratio at any given muscle weight than that of H lambs. Slowly grown lambs had heavier muscles at any given EBW than rapidly grown lambs. Content of DNA and protein:DNA ratio in ST muscle were unaffected by postnatal nutrition, but RNA content and RNA:DNA were greater and protein:RNA was lower at any given muscle weight in rapidly grown lambs. Results suggest that myofiber number in fetal sheep muscles is established before the presumed, negative effects of inadequate fetal nutrient supply on skeletal muscle growth and development become apparent. However, proliferation of myonuclei may be influenced by fetal nutrition in late pregnancy. Reduced myonuclei number in severely growth-retarded newborn lambs may limit the capacity for postnatal growth of skeletal muscles.", "year": 2000, "openAccessPdf": null, "authors": [{"authorId": "98905207", "name": "P.

The mean number of foetuses was 2\u00b77, with a range from 1 to 5. The ewes were individually penned and given a standard diet with metabolizable energy concentration 7\u00b77 MJ/kg and N concentration 21 g/kg, rationed at 2 kg/day during the first month and 1\u00b725 kg/day during the second and third. Allowances beyond that time were on two scales and depended on the number of foetuses being carried as diagnosed by radiography. The ewes were slaughtered between 50 and 145 days of gestation. The gravid uterus was dissected into foetal, placental, foetal fluid and empty uterus components. Equations were fitted to the weights of each component to describe the effects of stage of gestation, litter size and ewe weight. For the mean weight per foetus (Y, kg) the preferred equation is In (Y)= 2\u00b7419\u201317\u00b7574e-0.01976t\u201300079ft+0\u20130046w, where tis the time in days from conception, / is the number of foetuses and wis the weight (kg) of the ewe at mating. This is a version of the Gompertz equation, with additional terms to express the effects of / and w.The weights of the placenta and of the empty uterus were similarly fitted by versions of the Gompertz equation but the mean weight of fluids per foetus (Z, kg) or, rather, its natural logarithm was best described by a third degree polynomial, which is In(Z) = \u201311\u00b7518 + 0\u2013326t;\u20130\u00b700316t2+0\u00b70000102t3. None of the weights was significantly affected by the level of feeding in late pregnancy. Estimates of mean weights from the equations and of daily rates of gain in weight from the first differentials of the equations are tabulated against stage of gestation and litter size, and the forms of the weight, growth rate and specific growth-rate curves are illustrated graphically. The equation for foetal weight estimates that at the end of pregnancy the mean weight per foetus is reduced by a factor of 0\u201389 for each additional foetus being carried. The mathematical model implies that the differences originate in early pregnancy, when the factor is very close to unity, and that the mean weights gradually diverge. In the absence of direct evidence this would appear to be the simplest hypothesis, rather than the assumption in most of the earlier literature that the effect is entirely confined to the last 4 or 5 weeks of gestation. Just before parturition the total daily weight gain of quadruplet foetuses was about 250 g and was associated with a similar gain in weight of foetal fluids, the ratio of fluid weight to foetal weight appearing to increase with litter size. The ewes were clearly under considerable physical stress.

Reproduction traits typically have low to medium heritabilities and do not exhibit a noticeable response to phenotypic selection. Therefore, inclusion of genetic information of the genes associated with reproductive ability could efficiently enhance the selection response. The most important major genes affecting prolificacy and their genetic diversities in different sheep breeds were reviewed. Different causative mutations with major effects on reproductive traits including ovulation rate and litter size have been found in various sheep breeds around the world. A general overview of the studies on main prolificacy genes showed that some alleles may express different phenotypic effects in different breeds, and thus, further studies on epistatic effects are necessary for more understanding of genetic control of reproductivity in sheep. Regarding the polygenic control of fertility traits, application of new high-throughput technologies to find new variants is essential for future studies.

From examination of inherited patterns of ovulation rate in sheep, point mutations have been identified in two oocyte-expressed genes, BMP15 (GDF9B) and GDF9. Animals heterozygous for any of these mutations have higher ovulation rates (that is, + 0.8-3) than wild-type contemporaries, whereas those homozygous for each of these mutations are sterile with ovarian follicular development disrupted during the preantral growth stages. Both GDF9 and BMP15 proteins are present in follicular fluid, indicating that they are secreted products. In vitro studies show that granulosa and/or cumulus cells are an important target for both growth factors. Multiple immunisations of sheep with BMP15 or GDF9 peptide protein conjugates show that both growth factors are essential for normal follicular growth and the maturation of preovulatory follicles. Short-term (that is, primary and booster) immunisation with a GDF9 or BMP15 peptide-protein conjugate has been shown to enhance ovulation rate and lamb production. In summary, recent studies of genetic mutations in sheep highlight the importance of oocyte-secreted factors in regulating ovulation rate, and these discoveries may help to explain why some mammals have a predisposition to produce two or more offspring rather than one.", "year": 2004, "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://rep.bioscientifica.com/downloadpdf/journals/rep/128/4/1280379.pdf", "status": "BRONZE"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "4316451", "name": "K.

The optimal level of fecundity in most situations is well below the maximum attainable level and can be targeted by combining selection among and within breeds with use of an expanding array of single-gene mutations affecting ovulation rate and litter size. The heritability of litter size is approximately 0.10, allowing changes of up to 2%/year from simple mass selection. Mutations in several genes associated with the transforming growth factor beta superfamily (BMPRIB, GDF9 and sex-linked BMP15) can increase ovulation rates by 0.7-1.5 ova in heterozygous ewes. However, ewes that are homozygous for BMP15 or GDF9 mutations are sterile, so use of these mutations requires carefully structured breeding programmes. Improvements in fertility may be critical for autumn lambing or programmes that aspire to lamb throughout the year. Selection to improve fertility in spring matings has been successful; selected adult ewes have lambing rates of 80-85% in October and early November. The selected ewes have a dramatically reduced seasonal anestrus, and many ewes continue to cycle during spring and summer. Major genes affecting seasonal breeding have not been identified in sheep. Polymorphisms in the melatonin receptor 1a gene appear to be associated with seasonal breeding in some, but not all breeds. However, functional genomic studies of genes associated with circadian and circannual rhythms have potential to reveal additional candidate genes involved in seasonal breeding.", "year": 2008, "openAccessPdf": null, "authors": [{"authorId": "4303135", "name": "D.

When dairy cows are milked twice daily, the increase in milk yield from parturition to peak lactation is due to increased secretory activity per cell rather than to accretion of additional epithelial cells. After peak lactation, declining milk yield is due to loss of mammary epithelial cells by apoptosis. During lactation, only 0.3% of mammary cells proliferate in a 24-h period. Yet this proliferative rate is sufficient to replace most mammary epithelial cells by the end of lactation. Management practices can influence lactation persistency. Administration of bovine somatotropin may enhance persistency by increasing cell proliferation and turnover, or by reducing the rate of apoptosis. Increased photoperiod may also increase persistency of lactation by mechanisms that are as yet undefined. Increased milking frequency during the first weeks of lactation increases milk yield, even after return to less frequent milking, with increases of approximately 8% over the entire lactation. A mammary cell proliferation response to frequent milking during early lactation appears to be involved. Conversely, advanced pregnancy, infrequent milking, and mastitis increase death of epithelial cells by apoptosis. Regulation of mammary cell renewal provides a key to increasing persistency. Investigations to characterize epithelial cells that serve as the proliferative population in the bovine mammary gland have been initiated. Epithelial cells that stain lightly in histological sections are evident through all phases of mammary development and secretion and account for nearly all proliferation in the prepubertal gland. Characterization of these cells may provide a means to regulate mammary cell proliferation and thus to enhance persistency, reduce the effects of mastitis, and decrease the necessity for a dry period.", "year": 2003, "openAccessPdf": null, "authors": [{"authorId": "4697823", "name": "A.

Perhaps the most vivid example of the ability of the conceptus to regulate the maternal unit is its abili ty to program development of mammary gland so that production of milk is synchronized closely with delivery of the mature fetus from its in utero environment (parturition).

The mechanisms that regulate the selection of a species-specific number of dominant follicles for ovulation are not well understood. Cattle provide a very useful animal model for studies on follicular selection and dominance. During the bovine estrous cycle, two or three sequential waves of follicular development occur, each producing a dominant follicle capable of ovulating if luteal regression occurs. Follicles are large enough to allow analysis of multiple endpoints within a single follicle, and follicular development and regression can be followed via ultrasonographic imaging. Characteristics of recruited and selected follicles, obtained at various times during the first follicular wave, have been determined in some studies, whereas dominant and subordinate follicles have been compared around the time of selection in others. As follicular recruitment proceeds, mRNA for P450 aromatase increases. By the time of morphological selection, the dominant follicle has much higher concentrations of estradiol in follicular fluid, and its granulosa cells produce more estradiol in vitro than cells from subordinate follicles. Shortly after selection, dominant follicles have higher levels of mRNAs for gonadotropin receptors and steroidogenic enzymes. It has been hypothesized that granulosa cells of the selected follicle acquire LH receptors (LHr) to allow them to increase aromatization in response to LH, as well as FSH. However, LH does not appear to stimulate estradiol production by bovine granulosa cells, and the role of LHr acquisition remains to be determined. Recent evidence suggests a key role for changes in the intrafollicular insulin-like growth factor (IGF) system in selection of the dominant follicle. When follicular fluid was sampled in vivo before morphological selection, the lowest concentration of IGF binding protein-4 (IGFBP-4) was more predictive of future dominance than size or estradiol concentration. Consistent with this finding, dominant follicles acquire an FSH-induced IGFBP-4 protease activity. Thus, a decrease in IGFBP-4, which would make more IGF available to interact with its receptors and synergize with FSH to promote follicular growth and aromatization, appears to be a critical determinant of follicular selection for dominance.", "year": 2001, "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://academic.oup.com/biolreprod/article-pdf/65/3/648/10641273/biolreprod0648.pdf", "status": "BRONZE"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "145869064", "name": "J.

All farms were located in the south-west of Western Australia, and the flocks started lambing between mid-April and mid-July. The average liveweights of ewes pre-joining ranged over 40.2 to 61.8 kg, and average condition scores ranged from 2.2 to 4.2. Mean liveweight changes of the ewes ranged over losses of up to 8.5 kg to gains of up to 10.4 kg between consecutive recordings at 2 to 3 month intervals up to 12 weeks post lambing, and condition score changes ranged over minus 1.2 to plus 1.2. The greatest losses in liveweight and condition score in many flocks corresponded with the period from mid-pregnancy to marking, the time of greatest nutrient demand of the ewe. There was considerable variation between flocks in the percentage of dry ewes (2.9 to 17.7%), lambs born per ewe present at marking (83.0 to 147.3%), lambs alive per ewe present at marking (66.3 to 123.2%), and lamb deaths as a percentage of total lambs born (10.9 to 29.8%). For single and twin-born lambs, the percentage of lamb deaths between flocks ranged from 6.0 to 19.9% (mean = 11.0%) and 19.1 to 63.2% (mean = 33.1%) respectively. Of the ewes giving birth to twins, an average of 9.6% lost both lambs. The mean birthweights were 4.4 kg (range 3.6 to 5.1 kg) for singles and 4.0 kg (range 3.3 to 4.5 kg) for twins, and were highly correlated (r = 0 - 74, n = 13 flocks, P<0.01). Lamb growth to marking averaged 232 g head-1 day-1 and 205 g head-1 day-1, and from marking to weaning 198 g head-1 day-1 and 193 g head-1 day-1 for single and twin-born lambs respectively. The mortality rates of both single and twin-born lambs were highly correlated with mean liveweight of the ewes at mid-pregnancy (r = -0.64, P<0.01; r = -0.75, P<0.001; respectively). A kilogram increase in mean liveweight at mid-pregnancy was associated with declines in the mortality rates of single-born lambs of 0.7% units (s.e. = 0.23), and of twin-born lambs of 2.2% units (s.e. = 0.57). Mortality rates of the singles were highly correlated with that of twins (r = 0.86, P<0.001), with a 1% unit change in death rate of singles being associated with a 2.5% (s.e. = 0.41) unit change for twins. Mortality rates of twins were associated with mean cotyledon diameter measured in mid-pregnancy (r = -0.48, n = 13, P<0. l0), and mean umbilical resistance to blood flow (r = 0.78, n = 9, P<0.02). Growth from birth to weaning of single-born lambs was associated with the mean liveweight of the flock in mid-pregnancy (r = 0.72, P<0 .001). Clean fleece weight and mean fibre diameter of the fleeces from single.bearing and rearing ewes were correlated with mean ewe liveweight in mid-pregnancy (r = 0.56, P<0.05; r = 0.70, P<0.01; respectively). Staple strength was correlated with mean ewe liveweight at marking for both single and twin producing ewes (r = 0.72, n = 18, P<0.01; r = 0.74, n = 9, P<0.05; respectively). It was concluded that liveweight of the ewe in mid-pregnancy, which represents the sum of starting liveweight and liveweight change, is the most important single and practical criterion that can be used by a farmer to set the goals for nutritional management of the flock over pregnancy to improve lamb survival.", "year": 1992, "openAccessPdf": null, "authors": [{"authorId": "49857011", "name": "R.

At birth, small newborns had higher plasma concentrations of urea nitrogen (mean +/- SEM 8.31 +/- 0.25 vs 6.39 +/- 0.32 mM, P = 0.002) and somatotropin (ST, 49.1 +/- 17.0 vs 10.8 +/- 4.3 ng/mL, P = .045) and lower IGF-I (36.1 +/- 6.8 vs 157.7 +/- 21.8 ng/mL, P < 0.001) than large newborns. Plasma glucose (1.42 +/- 0.23 vs 2.63 +/- 0.95 mM, P = 0.147) and insulin (0.09 +/- 0.02 vs 0.13 +/- 0.06 ng/mL, P = 0.264) concentrations did not differ. Urea nitrogen concentration in plasma peaked and then declined rapidly in all lambs during the first week postpartum, and plasma ST declined on a body-weight-related basis from birth. During rearing to 20 kg LW, plasma insulin was higher in low- vs high-birth-weight lambs. Lambs fed ad libitum had greater plasma concentrations of glucose, urea nitrogen, insulin, and IGF-I compared to those fed a restricted diet (ADG = 150 g). The results suggest that during the early postpartum period, newborn lambs exhibit the fetal characteristic of high rates of amino acid oxidation. The results also support the notion that, at birth, low-birth-weight lambs are less mature than high-birth-weight lambs in aspects of metabolic and endocrine development, which may enhance their capacity to utilize amino acids for energy production and to support gluconeogenesis during the immediate postpartum period. Being small at birth also resulted in elevated plasma insulin concentrations when adequate nutriment to support moderate or rapid growth was provided postpartum, although it remains to be elucidated whether this more chronic effect persists in the longer term.", "year": 2002, "openAccessPdf": null, "authors": [{"authorId": "98905207", "name": "P.

Recent findingsOur recent studies demonstrated a complex age or time-dependent relationship between different and independent markers of an adverse intrauterine environment, including birth weight, twin and zygosity status on one side, and distinct defects of insulin secretion and glucose metabolism on the other side. SummaryThese novel findings may, to some unknown extent, influence and perhaps bias the heritability estimates of type 2 diabetes-related traits obtained using classical twin analyses. The studies add to the increasing evidence of the intrauterine environment as a \u2013 or the \u2013 key player in the cause and pathophysiology of type 2 diabetes and the metabolic syndrome. We and others have shown that monozygotic twins represent a powerful tool to demonstrate nongenetic associations between low birth weight and different phenotypes of the metabolic syndrome, including type 2 diabetes, insulin resistance and, recently, hypertension. Future studies of discordant monozygotic twins may provide novel and crucial mechanistic explanations of the link between low birth weight and the metabolic syndrome.", "year": 2007, "openAccessPdf": null, "authors": [{"authorId": "3180055", "name": "A.

The results showed that six sons of a carrier ram did not inherit the gene, but it was passed on to three of his five maternal grandsons.

Freemartinism arises when vascular connections occur between placentae of developing heterosexual twin foetuses, XX/XY chimerism develops, and ultimately there is masculinisation of the female tubular reproductive tract to varying degrees. The aim of this work was to report the clinical and cytogenetic studies performed in 28 cattle co-twins, 24 of which were cytogenetically chimeric (2n = 60, XX/XY), raised in the region of Campania (southern Italy). Clinical findings of the 16 freemartin females examined varied greatly, from a more female phenotype (normal body conformation with the presence of a blind-ending vagina and primordial ovarian and uterus structures) to a nearly male phenotype (body conformations with male traits and presence of primordial prepuce, penis and testicles). The 8 freemartin males, in spite of the presence of XX cells, had a normal body conformation and external genitalia and some of them were fertile. In addition to cytogenetic diagnosis we also verified chromosome fragility by testing for chromosome aberration (CA: aneuploidy, gaps, chromatid breaks, chromosome breaks and fragments) and sister chromatid exchange (SCE). Freemartins showed a higher percentage of aneuploid cells and significant statistical differences in mean values of gaps, chromatid breaks and chromosome breaks when compared with control animals. To our knowledge, this is the first time that chromosome instability has been evaluated by analyses of CA and SCE in freemartin cattle.", "year": 2008, "openAccessPdf": null, "authors": [{"authorId": "5690525", "name": "V.

Voluntary feed intakes were not altered by heat exposure except after 120 d of pregnancy, when feed intake was about 25% lower (P less than .10) by H than by TN ewes. Blood 3-hydroxybutyrate concentrations were not affected by heat, but plasma glucose concentrations were greater in H than in TN animals after 120 d (P less than .05). Placental weight, reduced by 54% (P less than .001) by heat exposure of ewes, was correlated positively with fetal weight and correlated negatively with fetal/placental weight ratio, fetal brain/liver weight ratio and fetal relative heart weight. Late in pregnancy, plasma concentrations of progesterone, cortisol and placental lactogen were reduced (P less than .01) in H ewes, whereas triiodothyronine levels were markedly lower (P less than .03) at all stages of pregnancy.

These results are consistent with our hypothesis that heat-induced fetal growth retardation is secondary to a primary reduction in placental growth; this could be mediated partly by reduced peripheral activity of thyroid hormones.

In anticipation of these needs several organs undergo maturational changes in late pregnancy aimed at meeting these requirements. The lungs mature structurally and functionally, becoming distensible and capable of coping with high surface tension when air enters the alveoli with the first breath. In the liver, glycogen accumulates and gluconeogenesis is initiated to meet the demands for glucose until feeding begins. There is an increase in the production of tri-iodothyronine and catecholamines in preparation for the sharp increase in metabolic rate and thermogenesis associated with breathing and the cold environment. All these dramatic maturational events are regulated by cortisol as are numerous others in most organ systems that contribute to neonatal well-being but on which survival is less dependent.

This may be because the physiological processes underlying reduced size at birth are different in singletons and twins. Periconceptional undernutrition can cause altered activity of the fetal and postnatal HPA axis without altering size at birth. However, the independent effects of periconceptional undernutrition and twinning on activity of the maternal and fetal HPA axes are not well described. We therefore studied maternal and fetal HPA axis function during late gestation in twin and singleton sheep pregnancies, either undernourished around conception or fed ad libitum. We found that twinning led to suppressed baseline HPA axis function and decreased adrenal sensitivity to ACTH stimulation but increased fetal pituitary ACTH response both to direct stimulation by CRH (ACTH area under the curve response: 29.7 +/- 2.2 vs. 17.1 +/- 1.6 ng/min x ml, P < 0.01) and to decreased cortisol negative feedback. In contrast, periconceptional undernutrition resulted in a decreased pituitary response (ACTH area under the curve response: 19.4 +/- 1.6 vs. 26.1 +/- 2.2 ng/min x ml, P = 0.02) but no difference in adrenal response. Thus, the HPA axis function of twin sheep fetuses in late gestation is very different from that of control and undernourished singletons. If the HPA axis is an important mediator between fetal adaptations and adult disease, these data may help explain why the relationship between fetal growth and postnatal physiology and disease risk is inconsistent in twins.", "year": 2008, "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://academic.oup.com/endo/article-pdf/149/3/1163/8999865/endo1163.pdf", "status": "BRONZE"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "14149167", "name": "C.

The extent to which such abnormalities are determined in early gestation, and may already be present in fetal life, is unknown. We studied the effect of periconceptional undernutrition on fetal growth and metabolism in late gestation. Ewes were either well fed throughout pregnancy (N) or undernourished to reduce ewe weight by 15% from 61 d before until 30 d after mating (UN). At 121 d, one cohort of ewes and their singleton fetuses (N, n = 10; UN, n = 10) were fasted for 72 h, given 25 g of glucose i.v. over 8 h, and refed. Fetal and placental weights were not different at 131 d. UN ewes had higher glucose, amino nitrogen, and Hb concentrations than N ewes. UN fetuses had higher glucose and lactate, and lower amino nitrogen and O2 concentrations and pH. UN ewes had higher insulin and lower IGF-I concentrations, and UN ewes and fetuses had higher placental lactogen concentrations. A second cohort (N, n = 8; UN, n = 10) were studied until term. Chest girth increment was reduced in UN fetuses until delivery, but birth weights were not significantly reduced. These findings suggest that fetal growth, metabolic and endocrine status, and placental function in late gestation are influenced by maternal nutrition in the periconceptional period, independent of fetal size.

We have recently demonstrated for the first time that embryo number, embryo sex, and alterations in the environment of the early embryo, including exposure to maternal undernutrition during the periconceptional period, alter the timing and level of activation of the pituitary\u2010adrenal axis in the sheep fetus during late gestation. There is a delay in activation of the fetal HPA axis in twin fetuses and we speculate that the diminished adrenocortical responsiveness in the twin fetus may be an adaptive response, which counters the impact of the potential enhanced intrauterine stress experienced by a twin fetus, thereby reducing the possibility of preterm delivery. We have also reported that a moderate restriction of maternal nutrition to during the periconceptional period (from 60 days before and for one week after conception) resulted in an earlier activation of the pituitary\u2010adrenal axis of twin, but not singleton, fetuses during late gestation. A series of studies using assisted reproductive technologies have also found that perturbation of the early embryonic environment results in a dysregulation of placental and fetal growth and development and in the timing of normal parturition. In summary, after several decades of work focussed on events in late gestation associated with the prepartum activation and stress responsiveness of the fetal HPA axis, our recent studies indicate that the environment of the early embryo may have a significant role to play in determining the timing and level of the prepartum activation of this axis and potentially on the functional capacity of the axis to respond to acute or chronic stress in later life.", "year": 2004, "openAccessPdf": null, "authors": [{"authorId": "3905228", "name": "I.

Because the placenta is the organ through which respiratory gases, nutrients, and wastes are transported between the maternal and fetal systems, its primary function is to supply the metabolic substrates necessary to support fetal growth. Placental growth and development, therefore, are critical for normal fetal growth and development. During the last half of gestation in mammals, growth of the fetus is exponential, whereas utero-placental growth slows or ceases. Nevertheless, unless placental transport capacity keeps pace with the continually increasing demands of the fetus, fetal growth will be compromised. Studies over the last two decades have shown that placental transport capacity does indeed keep pace with fetal growth. This increase in placental function can be accounted for primarily by continual increases in placental (uterine and umbilical) blood flows, associated with increased placental vascularity. Placental vascular growth and development, in turn, are probably regulated by angiogenic factors produced by the placental tissues themselves. These placental angiogenic factors are produced primarily by the maternal placental tissues, are heparin-binding, and seem to be related to the fibroblast growth factor family.

DESIGN--Follow up study of men born during 1920-30 whose birth weights and weights at 1 year were known. SETTING--Hertfordshire, England. SUBJECTS--468 men born in east Hertfordshire and still living there. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Fasting plasma glucose, insulin, proinsulin, and 32-33 split pro-insulin concentrations and plasma glucose and insulin concentrations 30 and 120 minutes after a 75 g glucose drink. RESULTS--93 men had impaired glucose tolerance or hitherto undiagnosed diabetes. They had had a lower mean birth weight and a lower weight at 1 year. The proportion of men with impaired glucose tolerance fell progressively from 26% (6/23) among those who had weighted 18 lb (8.16 kg) or less at 1 year to 13% (3/24) among those who had weighed 27 lb (12.25 kg) or more. Corresponding figures for diabetes were 17% (4/23) and nil (0/24). Plasma glucose concentrations at 30 and 120 minutes fell with increasing birth weight and weight at 1 year. Plasma 32-33 split proinsulin concentration fell with increasing weight at 1 year. All these trends were significant and independent of current body mass. Blood pressure was inversely related to birth weight and strongly related to plasma glucose and 32-33 split proinsulin concentrations. CONCLUSIONS--Reduced growth in early life is strongly linked with impaired glucose tolerance and non-insulin dependent diabetes. Reduced early growth is also related to a raised plasma concentration of 32-33 split proinsulin, which is interpreted as a sign of beta cell dysfunction. Reduced intrauterine growth is linked with high blood pressure, which may explain the association between hypertension and impaired glucose tolerance.", "year": 1991, "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://www.bmj.com/content/bmj/303/6809/1019.full.pdf", "status": "BRONZE"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2224975735", "name": "C.

Pregnant sheep were either fed to meet fully their nutritional requirements throughout gestation or 50% of this amount between 30 and 80 d gestation. After weaning, offspring were either made obese through exposure to a sedentary obesogenic environment or remained lean. Maternal nutrient restriction had no effect on birth weight or subsequent growth. At 1 wk of age, only, gene expression for neuropeptide Y in the hypothalamus was reduced in nutrient-restricted offspring. By 1 yr of age, all O animals had increased plasma leptin, nonesterified fatty acids, and insulin, with the latter effect amplified in NR offspring. Fasting plasma glucose, triglycerides, and cortisol were unaffected by obesity. The entrained reduction in physical activity that led to obesity persisted when all animals were maintained within individual pens. However, NRO offspring exhibited reduced daily food intake and were, therefore, no longer in positive \"energy balance.\" This adaptation was accompanied by elevated hypothalamic gene expression for the melanocortin-4 and insulin receptors, AMP-activated kinase, and acetyl coenzyme A carboxylase alpha. In conclusion, nutrient restriction specifically targeted over the period of early fetal brain development contributes to a profoundly different adaptation in energy balance after juvenile obesity.

Although there is an immediate requirement for this system to be functional at birth, it is unknown whether the components of this central neural network are expressed in the developing brain before birth. We therefore examined in the fetal sheep hypothalamus during late gestation gene expression for leptin receptor (OB\u2010Rb) and neuropeptides that regulate energy balance in the adult. Brains were collected from fetal sheep at 110\u2003days (n\u2003=\u200312) and 140\u2003days of gestation (n\u2003=\u20035) (term\u2003=\u2003150\u2003days) and gene expression was detected in all hypothalami using in situ hybridization with radiolabelled riboprobes for OB\u2010Rb, neuropeptide Y (NPY), agouti\u2010related peptide, pro\u2010opiomelanocortin and cocaine\u2010 and amphetamine\u2010regulated transcript (CART). All mRNAs were expressed in the arcuate nucleus of fetuses at both time points.

We have therefore demonstrated that adult\u2010like localization of gene expression for OB\u2010Rb and key appetite regulatory neuropeptides is established in the ovine hypothalamus before birth. Thus, the fetus possesses a central appetite regulatory neural network with the potential to respond to changes in nutrient supply, which could impact on energy balance regulation both before and after birth.", "year": 2004, "openAccessPdf": null, "authors": [{"authorId": "4549304", "name": "B.

We have tested the hypotheses that there are relationships between maternal weight or body condition at the time of conception and feto\u2010placental growth during the first 55 days of pregnancy, and that periconceptional undernutrition has a differential effect on these relationships in singleton and twin pregnancies. We have investigated the effect of periconceptional undernutrition in the ewe (control n= 24, restricted at 70% of control feed allowance, PCUN n= 21) from 45 days prior to mating until 7 days after mating on placental and fetal weight and on placental histology in singleton and twin pregnancies at 53\u201356 days' gestation, i.e. during the period of maximal placental growth. In control, but not PCUN ewes carrying singleton pregnancies, there were direct relationships between maternal weight gain during the periconceptional period and uteroplacental weights at 53\u201356 days' gestation. There were direct relationships, however, between placental and fetal weights in both control and PCUN singleton pregnancies. In contrast to the singletons, in control twin pregnancies, there was no effect of maternal weight gain in the periconceptional period on any measure of uteroplacental growth, and there was also no relationship between placental and fetal weight. This lack of a relationship may be related to the increased uteroplacental weight and mean placentome weight in the twin pregnancies (control singletons: 2.45 \u00b1 0.18 g; control twins: 4.10 \u00b1 0.62 g). In the PCUN group, however, a greater weight loss between the start of the feeding regime and post mortem at \u223c day 55, was associated with a larger placenta and fetus, and the direct relationship between placental and fetal mass was restored. In summary, the present study has demonstrated that there are important relationships between maternal weight gain during the periconceptional period and feto\u2010placental growth during the first 56 days of pregnancy, and that periconceptional undernutrition has a differential effect on these relationships in singleton and twin pregnancies. In singleton pregnancies, periconceptional undernutrition disrupts the relationship between maternal weight gain during the periconceptional period and uteroplacental growth, and in twin pregnancies periconceptional undernutrition results in the emergence of an inverse relationship between maternal weight gain during early pregnancy and uteroplacental growth and a dependence of fetal growth on placental growth. These changes highlight the importance of the periconceptional environment in setting the placental and fetal growth trajectories, and have implications for the programmed development of the metabolic, cardiovascular and endocrine systems of the fetus and adult.", "year": 2005, "openAccessPdf": null, "authors": [{"authorId": "4147174", "name": "S.

The ability to produce offspring is defined by Pearl and Surface as fertility, and in mammals this is the same as observed fecundity. 3.Embryological evidence from a number of forms indicates that, in most if not in all cases, actual fecundity is somewhat greater than the observed. The discrepancy is probably not so great, however, but what the number of offspring produced make a fair measure of fecundity. 4.Observations on multiparous animals (rats) show that the frequency of production of litters increases with the age of the female, at least within limits. This point is not capable of determination in the uniparous domesticated animals, at least on the data available. 5.The evidence also indicates, that in animals in general, there is an increase of litter size with the increasing age of the male. This usually goes to a maximum beyond which there is a decline. In the uniparous forms litter size is more commonly expressed in terms of the relative production of multiple births. to all births. 6.A review of the literature shows more or less fragmentary records on a considerable variety of animals, which all tend to substantiate the above statements. 7.The data on age of dams at time of giving birth to the 747,100 individuals recorded in the American Hereford and Aberdeen-Angus Herdbooks, volumes 1-42 and 1-26 respectively, show that there is at first a relatively rapid increase in fecundity with the advancing age of the female, followed by a more gradual rise, and without indication of a subsequent decline. 8.From the records of age of dam at birth of 1194 lambs in the flock of the University of Wisconsin, a similar curve was obtained, except that in this case it reached its maximum for dams at five years of age, beyond which there was a decided drop. 9.These findings on cattle and sheep coincide with earlier ones on other animals, since all show a general tendency for older females to produce larger litters than younger ones.", "year": 1920, "openAccessPdf": null, "authors": [{"authorId": "144178370", "name": "Sarah V.

Environmental factors, such as temperature and light, exert dramatic effects on the production, health, and well-being of animals during this period and after parturition. The aim of this review was to introduce effects of heat stress during late gestation on dairy cattle, and discuss the biological mechanisms that underlie the observed production and health responses in the dam and her fetus. Relative to cooled cows, cows that are heat stressed during late gestation have impaired mammary growth before parturition and decreased milk production in the subsequent lactation. In response to higher milk yield, cows cooled prepartum undergo a series of homeorhetic adaptations in early lactation to meet higher demand for milk synthesis compared with heat-stressed cows, but no direct effect of environmental heat stress on metabolism exists during the dry period. Prepartum cooling improves immune status of transition cows and evidence suggests that altered prolactin signaling in immune cells mediates the effects of heat stress on immune function. Late-gestation heat stress compromises placental development, which results in fetal hypoxia, malnutrition, and eventually fetal growth retardation. Maternal heat stress may also have carryover effects on the postnatal growth of offspring, but direct evidence is still lacking. Emerging evidence suggests that offspring from prepartum heat-stressed cows have compromised passive immunity and impaired cell-mediated immune function compared with those from cooled cows.", "year": 2013, "openAccessPdf": {"url": "http://www.journalofdairyscience.org/article/S0022030213003342/pdf", "status": "HYBRID"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "144421308", "name": "S.

To establish the role of placental angiogenesis in compromised pregnancies, we first evaluated the pattern of placental angiogenesis and expression of angiogenic factors throughout normal pregnancy. In addition, we and others have established a variety of sheep models to evaluate the effects on fetal growth of various factors including maternal nutrient excess or deprivation and specific nutrients, maternal age, maternal and fetal genotype, increased numbers of fetuses, environmental thermal stress, and high altitude (hypobaric) conditions. Although placental angiogenesis is altered in each of these models in which fetal growth is adversely affected, the specific effect on placental angiogenesis depends on the type of \u2018stress\u2019 to which the pregnancy is subjected, and also differs between the fetal and maternal systems and between genotypes.

Multiple linear regression was used to examine the association between difference in birth size and difference in blood pressure, adjusting for difference in body weight at age 7 years.

Twenty-six sets of twins were entered into the study, of which ten were used for organ sampling at birth and 16 were studied over the first year of life. Eleven sets were defined as being mismatched for birthweight as the weight difference between twins was >25%, with light lambs weighing 4.1 +/- 0.3 kg and heavy lambs weighing 5.1 +/- 0.1 kg. All remaining twins were matched in bodyweight, weighing 4.6 +/- 0.5 kg. During the rapid period of juvenile growth (i.e. one, three and six months of age) and following stabilization of bodyweight (i.e. 12 months of age) glucose tolerance tests were performed by intravenously injecting 0.8 mg kg(-1) bodyweight glucose. This was followed the next day with an insulin tolerance test, performed by intravenously injecting 0.08 units kg(-1) bodyweight insulin. At birth there were no differences in organ weight as a fraction of total bodyweight between matched and mismatched twins, but the ratio of liver to brain weight was lower in light compared with heavy twins. Light lambs remained lighter than their twins up to six months of age, and crown-rump length was also shorter. At one and three months of age there were no differences in basal plasma glucose concentrations between the groups, but glucose tolerance was greater in light compared with heavy lambs at one and six months of age. Insulin tolerance was greater in light compared with matched lambs at one and six months of age. In conclusion, it has been shown that size at birth of one twin in relation to its co-twin is one factor determining glucose regulation during postnatal life.

The aim of this thesis was to identify the breeding objectives for tropical small ruminants, and to develop appropriate breeding strategies for their improvement. The results indicated that breed substitution and crossbreeding programmes involving temperate breeds are rarely successful due to incompatibility of the genotypes with the farmers' breeding objectives and the production systems. Within-breed selection programmes utilizing indigenous breeds are likely to be more sustainable than breed substitution and crossbreeding. In addition, they help to maintain biodiversity. Indigenous genotypes were predominantly found among pastoral/extensive farmers and mixed crosses among smallholders. In general farmers perceived crosses less favourably than indigenous breeds for a range of traits. The effect was studied of including intangible benefits in the calculation of economic values of breeding goal traits. It resulted in increased values of traits related to longevity. Litter size and lambing frequency were more important traits in smallholder and pastoral production. 12-month live weight also featured prominently in pastoral production. Constraints to small ruminant productivity included low levels of management, disease and parasite challenge, inadequate feed and poor marketing. Nucleus breeding schemes are recommended to optimize the limited available resources. However, 'interactive cycling screening' schemes would be more practical under village settings as the farmers are actively involved in genetic improvement, and minimal recording is required in the commercial flocks. A single nucleus could serve both the smallholder and pastoral production. In conclusion, it is prudent to examine the production system holistically, and involve the producer at every stage in the planning and operation of a breeding programme, integrating traditional knowledge, practices, behaviour and values.", "year": 2004, "openAccessPdf": null, "authors": [{"authorId": "3807522", "name": "I.

However, in some flocks, reduction in this level of supervision may initially affect lamb mortality and animal welfare. In this review, possibilities for optimizing behavioral interaction between the ewe and lamb are considered, with the goal of improving lamb survival without the need for high levels of human supervision. At birth, ewes show specific behavioral patterns (e.g., licking or grooming, low-pitched bleats, udder acceptance) that facilitate the transition of the lamb from pre- to postnatal life and that accompany the formation of an exclusive olfactory memory for the lamb. The lamb also performs a specific sequence of behaviors directed toward standing, finding the udder, and sucking. The successful accomplishment of these behavior patterns is vital for the formation of a strong attachment between both partners, and for lamb survival. The expression of maternal behavior in the ewe is affected by her previous maternal experience, by nutrition in pregnancy, by breed, by temperament, and, to some extent, by the behavior of her lamb. The maternal care expressed by a ewe at parturition is indicative of her behavior throughout that lactation and in successive pregnancies, suggesting an underlying basis to maternal care intrinsic to that ewe. Studies with Scottish Blackface and Suffolk ewes show that ewes expressing high levels of maternal care have elevated plasma estradiol in late gestation compared with ewes with poorer maternal care, and that circulating estradiol concentration is correlated with maternal behaviors. Although the genetic basis of maternal behaviors has still to be fully determined, there are possibilities of improving maternal behavior by selection, and a better understanding of the neuroendocrine processes underlying individual differences in maternal behavior may help in developing selection strategies. In addition, selection on lamb behaviors, which show some genetic basis, may also be a route to improve lamb survival. Because behavior of both the ewe and lamb is affected by environmental factors, appropriate management, through pregnancy and at parturition, will enhance the expression of maternal behavior and lamb vigor, and so contribute to improving lamb survival.", "year": 2008, "openAccessPdf": null, "authors": [{"authorId": "2249027031", "name": "Cathy M.

This methodology allows for projecting high-dimensional data to a low-dimensional subspace that can be visualized by a human operator. It provides management with sophisticated tools, highly graphical in nature, to extract information regarding variation in process variables, correlations among these variables, as well as class separation, taking into account the multidimensional character of the data. Biplot methodology can also be applied to data sets exhibiting nonlinear behavior.

When tested several hours post-partum, ewes discriminated between their familiar lamb and its same-sex dizygotic twin that had been isolated at birth. The latter twins were nonetheless treated more positively than were unfamiliar alien lambs. A similar pattern of results was obtained for ewes tested with familiar and isolated monozygotic twins, and an unfamiliar alien lamb. To assess the possible influence of the differential pre-test treatments of familiar and isolated twins and the role of maternal chemical labels in offspring discrimination, the above experiments were replicated with the familiar lamb confined to a mesh cage that prevented maternal licking and nursing. Although isolated dizygotic twins were accepted to a lesser extent than their caged familiar twins, levels of maternal acceptance/rejection did not differ between the isolated twins and unfamiliar alien lambs. In contrast, isolated monozygotic twins were not treated differently than their caged familiar twins, but they were nonetheless distinguished from unfamiliar alien young. These latter data tentatively suggest that ewes may have discerned a greater resemblance between familiar and isolated MZ twins than between DZ twins of these two categories. It therefore appears that lambs' individually distinctive signatures reflect an interaction between genetically influenced processes and non-genetic factors (e.g. environmental or metabolic).", "year": 1993, "openAccessPdf": null, "authors": [{"authorId": "49440411", "name": "A.

Aspects of the ewe which influence the lamb. Lambs were removed from their mothers at birth and tested under one of seven conditions : (1) with the dam in her pen, or, in a circular arena, (2) in the presence of a stationary model ewe, (3) with the same model, but moving, (4) in the presence of a large, headless and legless moving object, (5) with stimulation by the sound of recorded bleats, (6) with tactile stimulation or (7) with no stimulation. Indices of responsiveness included movements of righting and standing, approach to the model, bleating and nosing of the model or the arena. Results showed that lambs tested with the stationary model stood most slowly whereas the presence of the moving model ewe was associated with rapid standing. The groups with no experimental stimulation at all, or with stimulation by the sound of recorded bleats, also stood rapidly. Bleating of the lambs was most prevalent in the group with no stimulation at all. Lambs presented with moving models approached them more rapidly and nosed them more than did those tested with the stationary model. More than any others, lambs in the \"stationary model\" group were quiescent for long periods. Lambs tested in the presence of their mothers and those given tactile stimulation were consistently low in the rank order for all indices of response; in particular they stood more slowly and bleated less than groups presented with moving models. It is concluded that the dam is a composite stimulus for her lamb; she activates it when she moves but also elicits responses which reduce its early activity. 2. Aspects of the lamb which attract the ewe. Ninety Merino ewes, from each of which the lamb had been removed at birth, were tested in their own pens under one of the following conditions: (i) with their own lambs; (ii) with a warm, moving lamb model soaked in amniotic fluid and accompanied by lamb bleats, or with the same model but (iii) without movement; (iv) without warmth; (v) without bleats or (vi) without amniotic fluid. A seventh group was tested with a white bowl of warm amniotic fluid, also moving and accompanied by lamb bleats. The ewes approached their own lambs and were much more attentive to them, than to any of the models.

Ewes which lambed later in the spring gained more weight during the last 6 weeks of pregnancy than did the earlier-lambing ewes. The birth weight of the lambs was not, however, affected by either the date of lambing or the ewes' gain in weight during the last six weeks of pregnancy. Significant breed differences in gestation length were recorded; these were 144\u00b77 days for the Border Leicester and 147\u00b71 days for the Welsh Mountain. Border Leicester ewes carrying pure-bred Welsh lambs had an average gestation of 149\u00b76 days, while Welsh Mountain ewes carrying pure-bred Border Leicester lambs had an average gestation of 146\u00b70 days. From the births of \u2018transferred\u2019 lambs, it appeared that the genetically smaller lamb was a cause of a longer gestation period. On the other hand, within groups, both live weight and length of \u2018cannon bone\u2019 of the lambs at birth increased when the gestation period was longer. The maternal environment affected foetal growth when the genotype for size of the foetus was different from that of the mother. The mean live weight and \u2018cannon-bone\u2019 length of cross-bred lambs born to Border Leicester ewes were 1\u00b708 lb. and 0\u00b737 cm. greater at birth than those of cross-bred lambs born to Welsh ewes. Comparable figures for the maternal influence from the results of transferring eggs from one breed to the other were 1\u00b796 lb. and 0\u00b733 cm. On the other hand, within breeds, there was no effect on the size of the lambs at birth of variations in the size of the ewes. The length of the \u2018cannon bone\u2019, which grows relatively rapidly during the early stages of growth (an early-maturing part of the body), was less influenced by the maternal environment than the late-maturing live weight. Mature ewes produced larger lambs at birth than young ewes. The mean differences at birth in weights and in lengths of \u2018cannon bone\u2019 of the lambs born to young and mature ewes were 1\u00b738 lb. and 0\u00b731 cm. respectively. From these and other experiments, the conclusions were drawn that: (i) the maternal influence on the size of young at birth is greater, in the larger species which have longer gestation periods, than the effect of the genotype of the young; (ii) the maternal organism competes with the foetus for nutrients, thus limiting the size of the young at birth; and (iii) the maternal organism may also influence pre-natal foetal growth by means of some internal secretion or metabolic substance. The amount of milk consumed by the lambs had a marked effect on their live weight gains during the first half but not during the second half of lactation. Variations in milk consumption by the lambs did not affect the growth in length of their \u2018cannon bones\u2019. The influence of the post-natal maternal environment is largely exerted through the milk yield of the ewe and causes of variation in this milk yield were reflected in the post-natal maternal influence estimated in these experiments. The total milk yield of ewes was affected by their date of lambing, that of late-lambing ewes being less than the yields of ewes which lambed earlier in the season.", "year": 1956, "openAccessPdf": null, "authors": [{"authorId": "2084345971", "name": "G.

In the present study, we applied the twin approach to estimate the contribution of genetic and environmental causes that may underlie the birth weight\u2013adult blood pressure association. Methods and Results\u2014Birth weights of 418 twin pairs were obtained prospectively, and resting and 24-hour ambulatory blood pressures were obtained at the age of 18 to 34 years. In women, resting systolic blood pressure decreased 4.27 mm Hg (P <0.001) and diastolic pressure decreased 2.18 mm Hg (P =0.02) per kilogram increase in birth weight. Similar associations were found for ambulatory measurements, although these were somewhat less pronounced. Pair-wise analysis confirmed these findings: twin pairs of whom both members had a low birth weight (<2500 g) had a higher systolic blood pressure compared with twins who both had a high birth weight (\u22652500 g). Systolic blood pressure of the lightest of a low-birth-weight pair was \u22654.7 mm Hg (P =0.02) higher and of the heaviest \u22652.4 mm Hg higher (P =0.2) than similar measurements in high-birth-weight pairs. Intrapair differences in blood pressure between the lightest and the heaviest at birth were only present in low-birth-weight pairs. The results were similar for monozygotic and dizygotic twin pairs. In men, no associations were found between birth weight and adult blood pressure. Conclusions\u2014These findings suggest that prenatal programming of adult blood pressure occurs at least in female twins. We suggest that particularly maternal influences, experienced by both twin members, may underlie the association between birth weight and blood pressure.

Body growth and composition, and some aspects of energetic efficiency.", "abstract": "We investigated the effects of birth weight and postnatal nutrition on growth characteristics of neonatal lambs. Low- and high-birth-weight male lambs were individually reared on a high-quality liquid diet to grow rapidly (ad libitum access to feed) or slowly (ADG 150 g) to various weights up to 20 kg live weight (LW). Average daily gain tended to be greater in the high- (mean+/-SE 345+/-14 g) than in the low- (329+/-15 g) birth-weight lambs given ad libitum access to feed owing to slower growth by the small newborns during the immediate postpartum period. At birth, on a weight-specific basis, small newborns contained 6.4% less nitrogen and tended to have more ash (8.9%) than the high-birth-weight newborns. Daily rates of fat, ash, and GE accretion were greater, and nitrogen accretion tended to be greater in the rapidly grown large newborns than in their small counterparts. At any given empty body weight (EBW) during rearing, low-birth-weight lambs contained more fat and less ash, resulting in slowly and rapidly grown small newborns containing 39.3 and 42.7 Mcal GE, respectively, at completion of the study (17.5 kg EBW), compared with 34.8 and 40.5 Mcal in their large counterparts. The differences in fatness and energy content between the birth weight categories are attributed to energy requirements for maintenance that were approximately 30% lower, coupled with higher relative intakes in the low-birthweight lambs, during the early postnatal period. At this time, the ability to consume nutrients in excess of lean tissue growth requirements was apparently more pronounced in small than in large newborns, which resulted in lower efficiency of energy utilization for tissue deposition. Furthermore, body composition differences between the slowly and rapidly reared lambs support the notion of a priority of lean tissue over fat when nutrient supply is limited.", "year": 1998, "openAccessPdf": null, "authors": [{"authorId": "98905207", "name": "P.

At first it was supposed by Roux, Weismann and others that differentiation is the result of qualitative nuclear divisions, different blastomeres thereby receiving the different kinds of nuclei which determine their subsequent differentiation. Later on this theory was disproved by numerous experiments showing that, during early cleavage at least, the distribution of the nuclei can be changed at will without altering the pattern of development. The cleavage nuclei have, therefore, been regarded as identical, and differentiation has been ascribed primarily to the well-known localizations in the egg cytoplasm.\n\nThis evidence, it should be emphasized, relates only to the early phases of development. During this time it is definitely true that the nuclei in the various blastomeres are equivalent. However, whether they remain equivalent or become differentiated as the various parts of the embryo differentiate has never been tested. The possibility that nuclei might differentiate in response to regional differences in the cytoplasm, and that such nuclear changes might have reciprocal effects on the cytoplasm during cell differentiation, was suggested by Morgan.1 More recently Schultz2\u2013 4 has discussed the problem more fully, indicating the known cytogenetical mechanisms that could account for nuclear differentiation, and Weisz5 has reviewed it in relation to ciliate morphogenesis.\n\nObviously this problem can be solved only by the development of a method for testing directly whether nuclei of differentiating embryonic cells are or are not themselves differentiated. This sort of test could be obtained, as suggested to us several years ago by Schultz, if it were possible to transplant nuclei. Ideally, this type of experiment should be carried out by transplanting the nucleus \u2026", "year": 1952, "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://europepmc.org/articles/pmc1063586?pdf=render", "status": "GREEN"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "145324029", "name": "R.

A cost-effective and efficient approach for the development of a custom genotyping assay interrogating 54,001 SNP loci to support GWA applications in cattle is described. A novel algorithm for achieving a compressed inter-marker interval distribution proved remarkably successful, with median interval of 37 kb and maximum predicted gap of <350 kb. The assay was tested on a panel of 576 animals from 21 cattle breeds and six outgroup species and revealed that from 39,765 to 46,492 SNP are polymorphic within individual breeds (average minor allele frequency (MAF) ranging from 0.24 to 0.27). The assay also identified 79 putative copy number variants in cattle. Utility for GWA was demonstrated by localizing known variation for coat color and the presence/absence of horns to their correct genomic locations. The combination of SNP selection and the novel spacing algorithm allows an efficient approach for the development of high-density genotyping platforms in species having full or even moderate quality draft sequence. Aspects of the approach can be exploited in species which lack an available genome sequence.

Data from twin calving Holstein cows in (TEC-DAP) farm in Al-Fayum Governorate between January 1997 and April 2008 were compared to those giving singles to study the differences in subsequent milk yield, previous and subsequent lactation and dry period length, as well as calf performance. The obtained average twinning rate was 1.4% during the period of the study. Cows giving twins had a significantly (p<0.01) lower daily, peak and 305-d milk yields than those with singles. There was no significant difference (p>0.05) in previous and subsequent lactation and dry period length between cows calving twins or singles. Calves born as twins were significantly (p<0.005) lighter at birth and weaning time than single calves, whereas total birth weight and total weaning weight were significantly (p<0.005) increased for twins than singles. Daily body weight gain from birth to weaning was significantly lower (p<0.005) for twin than single calves. Twinning in dairy cattle has a negative depressive effect on subsequent milk yield. Calf weight produced at weaning per cow calving can be increased in cows producing twins relative to cows producing singles. Alleviation of twinning constraints including dystocia, reduced calf survival and low reproductive performance requires improved management practices and early diagnosis of cows gestating twins in order to provide higher nutritive requirements in the last trimester of gestation and proper timing of drying off, and for higher assistance requirements at parturition. Thus, due to the increased disadvantages which did not offset the additional returns earned by calves, twinning in dairy cattle via selection or artificial induction appears not to be desirable.  The twinning rate in dairy cattle seems to have increased recently, and this may have important practical implications (Kinsel et al., 1998). The regulation of ovulation rate appears to be the primary mechanism for regulating litter size (Wiltbank et al., 2000). A number of factors were identified as possible regulators of twinning rates including age of dam (Jones and Rouse, 1920; Fricke and Wiltbank, 1999; Wiltbank et al., 2000), season (Cole and Rodolf, 1924) and genetics (Lush, 1925). Other factors have been found to be associated with twinning, including use of antibiotics or reproductive hormones, ovarian cysts, days open, and peak milk production (Pfau et al., 1948; Johansson et al., 1974; Nielen et al., 1989; Ryan and Boland, 1991; Lopez-Gatius et al., 1996; Kinsel et al., 1998; Wiltbank et al., 2000).Studies of the effects of twin births on milk production in the subsequent lactation are contradictory. Cows with twins had greater milk production than cows with singletons (Auran, 1974; Syrstad, 1974; Wood, 1975; Kay, 1978; Wood, 1984; Eddy et al., 1991) while in others lower milk yields were recorded (Bar-Anan and Bowman, 1974; Suchanek, 1977; Syrstad, 1977; Chapin and Van Vleck, 1980). Effect of twinning on birth weight, weaning weight and growth of calves has been investigated in several studies (Bellows et al., 1971; Turman et al., 1971; Bellows et al., 1974; Johansson et al., 1974; Davis et al., 1989; Gregory et al., 1990, 1996; Echternkamp and Gregory, 2002; Bell and Roberts, 2007).

Gonadal volume and germ cell number were significantly reduced, compared to control ovaries cultured in anhormonal medium, and epithelial cells with large clear cytoplasm linked by interdigitations differentiated in the gonadal blastema. These cells resembling rat fetal Sertoli cells became polarized and formed seminiferous cord-like structures delineated by a basal membrane containing laminin and fibronectin as is the case of testicular seminiferous cords at the first step of their differentiation. These data indicate that AMH is probably the testicular factor responsible for the morphological modifications of bovine freemartin gonads and suggest that this hormone could also be involved in normal morphological differentiation of the testis.

This study examined how maternal undernutrition in sheep affects the fetal hypothalamic glucocorticoid receptor (GR) and the appetite-regulating neuropeptides, proopiomelanocortin (POMC) and neuropeptide Y, which it regulates. In fetuses from ewes undernourished from -60 to +30 d around conception, there was increased histone H3K9 acetylation (1.63-fold) and marked hypomethylation (62% decrease) of the POMC gene promoter but no change in POMC expression. In the same group, acetylation of histone H3K9 associated with the hypothalamic GR gene was increased 1.60-fold and the GR promoter region was hypomethylated (53% decrease). In addition, there was a 4.7-fold increase in hypothalamic GR expression but no change in methylation of GR gene expression in the anterior pituitary or hippocampus. Interestingly, hypomethylation of both POMC and GR promoter markers in fetal hypothalami was also identified after maternal undernutrition from -60 to 0 d and -2 to +30 d. In comparison, the Oct4 gene, was hypermethylated in both control and underfed groups. Periconceptional undernutrition is therefore associated with marked epigenetic changes in hypothalamic genes. Increase in GR expression in the undernourished group may contribute to fetal programming of a predisposition to obesity, via altered GR regulation of POMC and neuropeptide Y. These epigenetic changes in GR and POMC in the hypothalamus may also predispose the offspring to altered regulation of food intake, energy expenditure, and glucose homeostasis later in life.", "year": 2010, "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://academic.oup.com/endo/article-pdf/151/8/3652/9010657/endo3652.pdf", "status": "BRONZE"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "144636437", "name": "A.

Research in the technology of bST has involved scientists and support from federal agencies, universities, and private industry. As a consequence of this extensive cooperation, more than 1000 bST studies have been conducted, which involved over 20,000 dairy cows, and results have been confirmed by scientists throughout the world. This quantity of published research is unprecedented for a new technology and greater than most dairy technologies in use. In contrast to steroids, bST is a protein hormone. Milk yield and persistency responses to bST have been observed for all dairy breeds examined. Quality of management is the major factor affecting magnitude of milk response to bST. The mechanism of action of bST involves a series of orchestrated changes in the metabolism of body tissues so that more nutrients can be used for milk synthesis. It is these coordinated changes that allow the animal to achieve an increased milk yield while remaining normal and healthy. Bioenergetic studies demonstrated that bST-supplemented animals are not stressed. Similarly, there are no adverse health effects from bST even under poor management conditions. Composition of milk (fat, protein, lactose, cholesterol, minerals, and vitamins) is not substantially altered when bST is used and does not differ in manufacturing characteristics. Public perception is of paramount importance if bST or any new technology is to be effectively implemented. New technology must be understood and perceived as safe and beneficial both by farmers, who would utilize it, and consumers, who would purchase the dairy products. With bST use, a unit of milk is produced with less feed and protein supplement and with a reduction in animal excreta (manure, urine, and methane). Nationally, the use of bST simply reinforces, but does not fundamentally change, dairy industry trends of increased milk yield per cow, reduced number of cows, and declining dairy farm numbers. For individual farms, bST technology is size-neutral. However, poorly managed farms where animals are stressed, underfed, or sick are at an economic disadvantage because they will achieve negligible milk response to bST.", "year": 1992, "openAccessPdf": null, "authors": [{"authorId": "6140585", "name": "D.

An unfavorable genetic trend of stillbirth was found for both the direct and maternal effect. The background for the genetic trends was an intense use of HF sires as sires of sons, which increased the proportion of HF genes to 94% in the Danish Holstein calves born in 2002. The effect of the imported HF genes was higher direct effects of calf size, calving difficulty, and stillbirth compared with the ODBW genes.

Starting 8 wk before expected calving, all animals were subjected to 1 of the following treatments: 8h of light and 16 h of dark (8L:16D), 16 h of light and 8h of dark (16L:8D), or 16L:8D plus melatonin feeding (16L:8D-melatonin). Each day at 1355 h, the animals in the melatonin treatment received orally a gelatin capsule containing 25mg of melatonin. The treatments ended at calving, when the animals were moved to the lactation barn; all animals were then subjected to about 16 h of light per day. At the beginning and end of the treatment period before calving, blood samples were taken from 6 heifers and 6 cows through a jugular cannula for 24h at 30-min intervals to monitor serum melatonin and prolactin concentrations. Milk production in the heifers was not affected by the photoperiod treatments. Early-lactation milk production was higher in the cows exposed to the short-day photoperiod than in those exposed to a long-day photoperiod (16L:8D and 16L:8D-melatonin), with averages of 36.7 \u00b1 0.9, 33.1 \u00b1 0.8, and 34.1 \u00b1 0.9 kg/d for 8L:16D, 16L:8D, and 16L:8D-melatonin, respectively. Photoperiod had no effect on late-lactation milk production in the cows. During lactation, the dry matter intake of heifers was not affected by the treatments, but dry matter intake of the cows exposed to a short-day photoperiod was greater than that of the cows exposed to a long-day photoperiod. Feed efficiency of heifers was improved by short-day photoperiod. During the treatment period, prolactin concentration was lower in the animals exposed to a short-day photoperiod than in those exposed to a long-day photoperiod, was lower with the 16L:8D-melatonin treatment than with the 16L:8D treatment, and tended to be lower with the 8L:16D treatment than with the 16L:8D-melatonin treatment, with averages of 3.5 \u00b1 0.8, 9.9 \u00b1 0.8, and 6.0 \u00b1 0.8 ng/mL for 8L:16D, 16L:8D, and 16L:8D-melatonin, respectively. In early lactation, prolactin concentration was lower in the heifers exposed to the 16L:8D photoperiod during the dry period than in those exposed to the 8L:16D photoperiod or fed melatonin. In conclusion, a short-day photoperiod during the dry period transiently increases milk production of cows and the feed efficiency of heifers in the following lactation. However, melatonin cannot be used to mimic a short-day photoperiod during the dry period.", "year": 2014, "openAccessPdf": {"url": "http://www.journalofdairyscience.org/article/S0022030214002434/pdf", "status": "HYBRID"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "145402574", "name": "P.

Current estimates suggest that in the UK only around 50% of dairy cows calve to a particular insemination indicating that in 50% of cows pregnancy fails. The timing and extent of these losses has been reviewed extensively by Sreenan and Diskin (1 986) and more recently by Peters (1996). These reviews report a fertilisation rate of around 90%. Pregnancy rate then falls to around 80% by day 10-13 due to failed embryo development. By day 19 this figure has fallen to around 60-65% due to failure of the embryo to prevent luteolysis and maintain the secretion of progesterone necessary for its continued development. Thus around 2530% of pregnancies fail due to early embryo mortality. Further late embryo losses of around 510% and an abortion rate of around 5% lead to a final calving rate of around 50%. From these figures, based on a number of studies, it can clearly be seen that the most important factor contributing to early pregnancy failure is embryo mortality. This mortality results partly from the direct failure of the embryo to develop, but more commonly from the failure of the embryo to prevent luteolysis and maintain the pregnancy.", "year": 1999, "openAccessPdf": null, "authors": [{"authorId": "49254854", "name": "G.

The M-N system of man (Landsteiner and Levine, 1928) is a case in point, For a period of approximately 20 years that system was regarded for all purposes as a two-blood-factor (M and N), two-allele (LM and LN), three-phenotype (M, MN, and N) system, even though variants (Nz) of agglutinogen N were known. Then, beginning with the discovery of blood factor S (Walsh and Montgomery, 1947), the M-N-S system, as it is presently known, has become expanded into a polyphenotype system involving numerous alleles, perhaps well over 30. The F-V system of cattle was, a t the time of its inception in 1943, a perfect analogue in infrahuman species of the original M-N system of man. Like M-N, it appeared as a two-blood-factor (F and V), two-allele (f\" andfV), three-phenotype (F, FV and V) system (Stormont, 1952), and it remained that way for approximately 15 years. Like M-N-S, F-V is presently experiencing a period of expansion but here the deveIopments are so recent that they have not had previous coverage in published writings. Another system in cattle which has been undergoing considerable expansion within the past year or so is that now known as A but originally called A-H. I t is the aim of the present review to bring the reader up to date not only with the developments in established systems of cattle blood groups but also with the studies of new systems.

A philosophy is presented for model-based data analysis and a general strategy outlined for the analysis of empirical data. The book invites increased attention on a priori science hypotheses and modeling. Kullback-Leibler Information represents a fundamental quantity in science and is Hirotugu Akaike's basis for model selection. The maximized log-likelihood function can be bias-corrected as an estimator of expected, relative Kullback-Leibler information. This leads to Akaike's Information Criterion (AIC) and various extensions. These methods are relatively simple and easy to use in practice, but based on deep statistical theory. The information theoretic approaches provide a unified and rigorous theory, an extension of likelihood theory, an important application of information theory, and are objective and practical to employ across a very wide class of empirical problems. The book presents several new ways to incorporate model selection uncertainty into parameter estimates and estimates of precision. An array of challenging examples is given to illustrate various technical issues. This is an applied book written primarily for biologists and statisticians wanting to make inferences from multiple models and is suitable as a graduate text or as a reference for professional analysts.", "year": 2003, "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/bfm:978-0-387-22456-5/1?pdf=chapter%20toc", "status": "GREEN"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "33457237", "name": "K.

Cows were diagnosed pregnant on d 31 of gestation based on presence of a fetal heartbeat and reconfirmed to be pregnant on d 59 of gestation. Late EM occurred when a cow had a viable embryo on d 31 of gestation but not on d 59 following TAI or TET. Only pregnant cows on d 31 were included in the analysis (TAI-maintained, n=413; TAI-EM, n=77; TET-maintained, n=238; TET-EM, n=47). Cows that were pregnant at d 31 of gestation and maintained the pregnancy until d 59 had significantly higher circulating concentrations of PAG at d 31 of gestation compared with cows that experienced late EM between d 31 and 59 of gestation in both TAI and TET. To conduct a more stringent test of the effectiveness of a single circulating PAG concentration (d 31) to predict EM, a receiver-operating characteristic curve was generated to identify a PAG concentration on d 31 that would predict EM with \u226595% accuracy in cows that received TAI or TET. Based on positive and negative predicative value analysis, a circulating concentration of PAG below 1.4 ng/mL (TAI; minimal detectable level 0.28 ng/mL) and 1.85 ng/mL (TET) was 95% accurate in predicting EM (between d 31 and 59) at d 31 of gestation, respectively. Following TET, embryonic loss was tracked by Doppler ultrasound, progesterone, and PAG from d 24 to 59 of gestation, with more than 50% of the loss occurring between d 31 and 38 of gestation. In summary, circulating concentrations of PAG on d 31 of gestation may provide a good marker for predicting EM between d 31 and 59 of gestation, and the data suggest that this model could help predict which cows will undergo late EM.", "year": 2016, "openAccessPdf": {"url": "http://www.journalofdairyscience.org/article/S0022030215009285/pdf", "status": "HYBRID"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "6118647", "name": "K.

Data from 5,979 cows in Ontario (Canada) and several US states were obtained from 4 previously reported studies. For each metabolite and each of 3 sampling weeks (-1, +1, and +2 relative to calving), an optimal threshold was calculated based on having the maximum combined sensitivity (Se) and specificity (Sp) and used to categorize the serum concentrations into high and low risk groups. Logistic regression models were built for each metabolite and each week of sampling, as well as considering together all metabolites in wk -1 and wk +1 relative to calving. Cow was considered the experimental unit and herd as a random effect. Considered separately, precalving NEFA \u2265 0.4 mmol/L [odds ratio (OR)=1.8; 95% confidence interval (CI)=1.4 to 2.2], NEFA \u2265 0.8 mmol/L in wk +1 relative to calving (OR=2.0; 95% CI=1.5 to 2.6) and NEFA \u2265 0.8 mmol/L in wk +2 (OR=4.2; 95% CI=1.9 to 9.4 for cows in lactation 2; OR=2.1; 95% CI=1.4 to 3.3 for cows in lactation \u2265 3) were each associated with an increased risk of culling within the first 60 DIM. Similarly, BHBA \u2265 0.7 mmol/L in wk -1 (OR=1.8; 95% CI=1.3 to 2.5), BHBA \u2265 1.2 mmol/L in wk +1 (OR=1.8; 95% CI=1.4 to 2.2), and BHBA \u2265 1.6 mmol/L in wk +2 (OR=3.2; 95% CI=1.6 to 6.4 for cows in lactation 2; OR=2.3; 95% CI=1.6 to 3.3 for cows in lactation \u2265 3) were each associated with an increased risk of culling within the first 60 DIM.

In conclusion, elevated serum NEFA and BHBA concentrations and lower serum calcium concentrations within 1 wk before calving through 2 wk after calving were associated with an increased risk of culling in early lactation.

Statistical analyses were performed using logistic regression models and Cox proportional hazard models. The prevalence of anovulation was 72, 44, 26, and 17% at wk 3, 5, 7, and 9, respectively. Cows were classified according to their ovulatory status as having luteal function at 21 DIM (Cyc21), as having low P4 at 21 DIM but having luteal function at least once at 35 or 49 or 63 DIM (Cyc63), or being anovulatory at 63 DIM (Anov63; no samples with P4 >1 ng/mL). Factors associated with early ovulation (Cyc21) included season, parity, decreased haptoglobinemia, and decreased serum NEFA concentration before and after parturition. Risk factors for prolonged anovulation (Anov63) included cytological endometritis, increased haptoglobinemia, and greater serum NEFA concentrations before and after parturition. Cows classified as Anov63 had an increased median time to first breeding compared with Cyc63 (74.1 vs. 73.2 d). The effect of prolonged postpartum anovulation on median time to pregnancy was conditional on parity group; a detrimental effect was present in cows of parity \u22653 (129 d for Cyc21, 151 d for Cyc63, and 180 d for Anov63), but no effect was observed in cows of parity \u22642. Overall, these findings suggest that postpartum anovulation was associated with indicators of energy balance and uterine inflammation, and with detrimental effects on reproductive performance.", "year": 2012, "openAccessPdf": {"url": "http://www.journalofdairyscience.org/article/S002203021200149X/pdf", "status": "HYBRID"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "144785426", "name": "J.

Fifty-five Holstein freestall dairy herds located across the United States and Canada were selected and visited weekly for blood sample collection from 2,365 cows. Only diseases that were consistently recorded across herds and blood samples collected before the disease occurred were considered. Metabolite concentrations in serum in wk -1 relative to calving were considered as predictors of retained placenta (RP) and metritis, and metabolite concentrations in serum in wk -1 and wk +1 relative to calving were considered as predictors of displaced abomasum (DA). For each disease, each metabolite, and week of sampling in the case of DA, a critical threshold was calculated based on the highest combined sensitivity and specificity and used to categorize the serum concentrations into high and low risk categories. Multivariable logistic regression models were built for each disease of interest and week of sampling, considering cow as the experimental unit and herd as a random effect. Cows with precalving serum NEFA concentrations \u2265 0.3 mEq/L were more likely to develop RP [odds ratio (OR) = 1.8; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.3 to 2.6] and metritis (OR = 1.8; 95% CI = 1.5 to 2.9) after calving than cows with lower NEFA concentrations.

Essentially all dairy cattle experience a period of insulin resistance, reduced feed intake, negative energy balance, hypocalcemia, reduced immune function, and bacterial contamination of the uterus soon before, or in the weeks after calving. One-third of dairy cows may be affected by some form of metabolic or infectious disease in early lactation. Routine, proactive actions, observations, or analysis are intended to accurately and efficiently provide early detection of problems, to provide an opportunity for investigation and intervention in order to limit the consequences and costs of health problems and reduced animal performance or welfare. Methods of early detection include monitoring of disease and culling records, feed intake, milk production, body condition, and simple metabolic tests. Methods, strategies, and interpretation of measurement of peripartum concentrations of non-esterified fatty acids (NEFA) and beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB) as indicators of aspects of energy status and disease risk are reviewed. High NEFA (> 0.4 mmol/l) in the last 7 to 10 days before expected calving is associated with increased risk of displaced abomasum (DA), retained placenta, culling before 60 days in milk, and less milk production in the first 4 months of lactation. Subclinical ketosis (serum BHB >1200 to 1400 micromol/l) in the first or second week after calving is associated with increased risk of DA, metritis, clinical ketosis, endometritis, prolonged postpartum anovulation, increased severity of mastitis, and lower milk production in early lactation.

The models included dystocia score, parity, and season of calving as explanatory variables for heifer events and also calf gender, and single or twin birth for the stillbirth models. Heifer calves born to dams having severe dystocia had greater odds of stillbirth [odds ratio (OR) = 20.7] and treatment of respiratory disease (OR = 1.7), digestive disease (OR = 1.3), and overall heifer mortality (OR = 6.7). Calf gender and dam parity interacted with calving ease to affect stillbirths. For calves having severe dystocia, heifer calves and calves born to multiparous dams were at increased risk of stillbirth compared with bull calves and calves born to primiparous dams, respectively. Survival analysis demonstrated that severe dystocia was associated with stillbirths and deaths up to 30 d of age. Relatively simple interventions have the potential to significantly reduce the impact of dystocia on calf mortality and morbidity on dairy farms. Education of farm management and personnel in strategies to reduce dystocia and its effect on calf health should be a priority according to the results of this study.", "year": 2007, "openAccessPdf": {"url": "http://www.journalofdairyscience.org/article/S0022030207716612/pdf", "status": "HYBRID"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "37227602", "name": "J.

Data were 4528 records of births between 1968 and 1999 from the Iowa State University research dairy farm in Ankeny. The incidence of PM was 7.1%; dystocia was 23.7%. A logistic regression model was used to predict both PM and dystocia. The PM model included effects of year of birth, season (summer or winter), dystocia, parity (first or later), birth weight (kg), ratio of calfs birth weight to dam's weight (%), and gestation length (d). Odds of PM increased by 2.1%/yr. Calves born in the winter have a 36% higher risk of PM than calves born in the summer. Difficult births tend to result in PM 2.7 times more often than unassisted births. First-parity cows have a 2.4 times higher risk of PM than cows in later parities. Probabilities of PM for birth weights of 29, 35, 40, 46, and 52 kg were 2.1, 2.5, 3.4, 5.1, and 9.6%, respectively, when other factors were set at their average value. Similarly, ratios of calf to cow weight of 4.5, 5.7, 6.9, 8.1, and 9.3% yield probabilities of PM at 8.2, 4.2, 3.1, 3.5, and 5.7%, respectively. Finally, gestation lengths of 268, 273, 279, 284, and 290 d yield probabilities of PM of 5.5, 3.9, 3.1, 3.1, and 3.6%, respectively. The dystocia model included effects of year of birth, season, sex of calf, PM, parity, birth weight, and pelvic area (externally measured). Odds for dystocia decreased by 4.7%/yr. Calves born in the winter have a 15% higher risk of dystocia than calves born in the summer. Odds of male calves needing assistance were 25% greater than female calves. If a calf died in the first 48 h, then it is 2.7 times more likely that the calf needed assistance. First-parity cows have a 4.7 times higher risk of dystocia than cows in later parities.

Milk production per cow has increased steadily because of a combination of improved management, better nutrition, and intense genetic selection. Dairy farms are larger, and nearly 30% of the dairy cows in the United States are on farms with 500 or more cows. The shift toward more productive cows and larger herds is associated with a decrease in reproductive efficiency. Cows with the greatest milk production have the highest incidence of infertility, but epidemiological studies suggest that, in addition to milk production, other factors are probably decreasing reproductive efficiency in our dairy herds. The reproductive physiology of dairy cows has changed over the past 50 yr, and physiological adaptations to high milk production may explain part of the reproductive decline. Critical areas for new research include control of the estrous cycle, metabolic effects of lactation on reproduction, mechanisms linking disease to reproduction, and early embryonic mortality. Solving reproductive loss in dairy cows will not be easy because only a small number of research groups study reproduction in postpartum dairy cows. Therefore, the present research base will need to be expanded. For this to occur, research funding must be increased above its current level and a renewed emphasis must be placed on solving the emerging crisis of infertility in dairy cows.", "year": 2001, "openAccessPdf": null, "authors": [{"authorId": "5792069", "name": "M.

A sample of 666,341 births from the MidStates Dairy Records Processing Center and the National Association of Animal Breeders was used to examine the influence of sire, herd, year, season, sex of calf, parity of dam, calving ease, and gestation length on the survival of the calf. Parity was scored as an ordered variable (1, 2, 3+). Calving ease was scored on a scale of 1 (no assistance) to 3+ (needed assistance). An increasing trend in stillbirths was found in primiparous and multiparous cows. The percentage of stillborn calves in primiparous cows increased from 9.5 in 1985 to 13.2 in 1996. Stillbirths in multiparous cows increased from 5.0 to 6.6% from 1985 to 1996. Variation about the trend was greater in primiparous cows than in multiparous cows. Dystocia was a major determinant of stillbirth incidence, but the association was stronger in primiparous cows. Sex of calf had different associations with stillbirth incidence in primiparous and multiparous cows. Gestation length and season of birth also had significant associations with stillbirth incidence. Logistic regression models with fixed and random effects were fit to the data to preserve the binary nature of the stillbirth response. The expected probability of stillbirths for an average herd and sire was 10% for primiparous cows and 5% for multiparous cows.

A modified chi-squared automated interaction detection algorithm was used to develop classification trees explaining the most likely sequence of factors that result in a stillborn calf. The data were 666,341 births from the MidStates Dairy Records Processing Center and the National Association of Animal Breeders. Primiparous and multiparous cows clearly differ in the rate of stillbirths, 11.0 and 5.7%, respectively. Dystocia followed parity as the next most important factor within both primiparous and multiparous cows. In primiparous cows, season, year of birth, or gestation length ranked third as an important predictor for dystocia equal to 1, 2, or 3+, respectively. Gestation length ranked third in importance among the factors that affect stillbirth rates for all levels of dystocia in multiparous cows. Among multiparous cows needing assistance (dystocia 3+), stillbirth rates were greatest for shorter gestations less than the average of 280 d, 55.3% for -15 to -12 d, 45.5% for -11 to -9 d, 33.7% for -8 to -5 d, 23.8% for -4 to 13 d, and 35.4% for 14 to 15 d. Gestation length pinpointed the time when stillbirths occurred, as indicated by the increase from 23.8% stillbirth rate among calves born at or above the mean gestation length to 55.3% for those calves born -15 to -12 d below the mean gestation.

Cows (n=303) from a commercial dairy herd in Argentina were studied. Cows were scored for body condition, and blood samples were collected on d -14, 7, 21, 31, 41, and 50 relative to parturition. Cows having a watery, purulent, or brown, and fetid vaginal discharge (VD) and rectal temperature \u2264 39.2\u00b0C were diagnosed as having clinical metritis, and those having a similar VD and rectal temperature >39.2\u00b0C were diagnosed as having puerperal metritis. Both clinical and puerperal metritis cows were randomly assigned to control (no treatment) or ceftiofur group (2.2mg/kg\u00d73 consecutive days). Cure was declared if clear VD was observed at 21 d in milk (DIM). Blood samples were analyzed for nonesterified fatty acids, \u03b2-hydroxybutyrate, and blood urea nitrogen using commercial kits, and for insulin-like growth factor-1, insulin, and leptin by RIA. Data were analyzed with PROC MIXED, GENMOD, PHREG, and LIFETEST from SAS (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC). The risk for metritis increased with dystocia, retained fetal membranes, and dead calf [AOR (adjusted odds ratio)=2.58, 95% CI: 1.189-5.559], and as prepartum nonesterified fatty acids levels increased (AOR=1.001, 95% CI: 0.999-1.002). Conversely, risk decreased as prepartum insulin-like growth factor-1 increased (AOR=0.65, 95% CI: 0.349-1.219). Cows having either clinical or puerperal metritis produced less milk by 90 DIM than did healthy cows (2,236 \u00b1 172 vs. 2,367 \u00b1 77 vs. 2,647 \u00b1 82 kg, respectively). Cows with puerperal metritis had lower risk for pregnancy by 100 DIM (AOR=0.189, 95% CI: 0.070-0.479) and a lower hazard rate for pregnancy by 150 DIM (hazard rate: 0.753, 95% CI: 0.621-0.911), and took longer to get pregnant (129 vs. 111 vs. 109 d, for puerperal metritis, clinical metritis, and healthy cows, respectively). Ceftiofur treatment was not associated with cure rate or milk yield but was related to increased risk for pregnancy at timed artificial insemination (AOR=2.688, 95% CI: 0.687-10.832), and for lower risk of reproductive cull (AOR=0.121, 95% CI: 0.014-1.066). In conclusion, abnormal calving and negative energy balance are associated with increased risk for metritis. Metritis, especially puerperal metritis, correlates with reduced milk production and poor reproductive performance. Finally, the likelihood for having a normal VD (indicative of cure) increased 2.6% for every day of increase in postpartum time and was 2 times higher for cows with clinical metritis than for those with puerperal metritis.", "year": 2013, "openAccessPdf": {"url": "http://www.journalofdairyscience.org/article/S0022030213002348/pdf", "status": "HYBRID"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "6188111", "name": "M.

Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID; metritis) or endometritis affects \u223c40% of cattle after parturition. We tested the expectation that multiple genetically diverse E. coli from the environment opportunistically contaminate the uterine lumen after parturition to establish PID. Methodology/Principal Findings Distinct clonal groups of E. coli were identified by Random Amplification of Polymorphic DNA (RAPD) and Multilocus sequence typing (MLST) from animals with uterine disease and these differed from known diarrhoeic or extra-intestinal pathogenic E. coli. The endometrial pathogenic E. coli (EnPEC) were more adherent and invasive for endometrial epithelial and stromal cells, compared with E. coli isolated from the uterus of clinically unaffected animals. The endometrial epithelial and stromal cells produced more prostaglandin E2 and interleukin-8 in response to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) purified from EnPEC compared with non-pathogenic E. coli. The EnPEC or their LPS also caused PID when infused into the uterus of mice with accumulation of neutrophils and macrophages in the endometrium. Infusion of EnPEC was only associated with bacterial invasion of the endometrium and myometrium. Despite their ability to invade cultured cells, elicit host cell responses and establish PID, EnPEC lacked sixteen genes commonly associated with adhesion and invasion by enteric or extraintestinal pathogenic E. coli, though the ferric yersiniabactin uptake gene (fyuA) was present in PID-associated EnPEC. Endometrial epithelial or stromal cells from wild type but not Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) null mice secreted prostaglandin E2 and chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand 1 (CXCL1) in response to LPS from EnPEC, highlighting the key role of LPS in PID.

Cows at risk for metritis have shorter feeding times in the days before calving but prepartum dry matter intake (DMI) and water intake may also be useful in identifying cows at risk for this disease. Feeding, drinking, and intake measures may also be affected by social interactions among group-housed cows. The objective of this study, therefore, was to measure intake, feeding, drinking, and social behavior to determine which measures could identify cows at risk for metritis after calving. Feeding and drinking behavior and intake measures were collected from 101 Holstein dairy cows from 2 wk before until 3 wk after calving using an electronic monitoring system. Social behavior at the feed bunk was assessed from video recordings. Metritis severity was diagnosed based on daily rectal body temperature as well as condition of vaginal discharge that was assessed every 3 d after calving until d +21. In this study, 12% of cows were classified as severely metritic and 27% as mildly metritic. Prepartum feeding time and DMI were best able to identify cows at risk for metritis. Cows that developed severe metritis spent less time feeding and consumed less feed compared with healthy cows beginning 2 wk before the observation of clinical signs of infection. For every 10-min decrease in average daily feeding time during the week before calving, the odds of severe metritis increased by 1.72, and for every 1-kg decrease in DMI during this period, cows were nearly 3 times more likely to be diagnosed with this disorder. During the week before calving, cows that were later diagnosed with severe metritis had lower DMI and feeding times during the hours following fresh feed delivery. During this period these cows also engaged in fewer aggressive interactions at the feed bins compared with cows that remained healthy.

Four observers independently assigned a body condition score (five-point scale, .25 increments) and described the appearance of seven body regions of 225 Holstein cows. Areas described were the thurl region, ischial and ileal tuberosities, ilio-sacral and ischio-coccygeal ligaments, transverse processes of the lumbar vertebrae, and spinous processes of the lumbar vertebrae. An absolute body condition score was designated for each cow based on the modal body condition score for all observers. If there was no modal body condition score, the mean score was used for the absolute body condition score. Statistical analysis of principal components was used to examine the relationship between body region description and absolute body condition score. Descriptions of body regions were highly correlated across all absolute body condition scores. Four principal component vectors explained 83.6% of the variation of the body region correlation matrix. The first principal latent vector accounted for 55% of the variation and was uniformly correlated with all body regions. Analysis of variance of first principal latent vector as the dependent variable and absolute body condition score as the class variable indicated that body condition could be separated into .25 units between 2.5 and 4.0, inclusively.

Data were from 1,374 multiparous Holstein lactations for calvings from March 1981 through February 1982 in 31 commercial herds in central New York. Periparturient disorders occurred as a complex. Odds ratios for the multiplicative effects of parturient paresis on incidence of veterinary-assisted dystocia, retained placenta, complicated ketosis, and clinical mastitis were 7.2, 4.0, 23.6, and 5.4, respectively. Reproductive disorders were interrelated. Retained placenta, left displaced abomasum, and parturient paresis directly increased risk of complicated ketosis (odds ratios were 16.4, 53.5, and 23.6, respectively). Higher terciles of estimated energy intake in the last 3 wk of the dry period decreased risk of veterinary-assisted dystocia and left displaced abomasum, while higher terciles of estimated protein intake decreased risk of retained placenta and uncomplicated ketosis.

Circulating P4 concentration is determined by a balance between P4 production, primarily by the corpus luteum (CL), and P4 metabolism, primarily by the liver. The volume of luteal tissue and number and function of large luteal cells are primary factors determining P4 production. Rate of P4 metabolism is generally determined by liver blood flow and can be of critical importance in determining circulating P4 concentrations, particularly in dairy cattle. During timed artificial insemination (AI) protocols, elevations in P4 are achieved by increasing number of CL by creating accessory CL or by supplementation with exogenous P4. Dietary manipulations can also alter circulating P4, although practical methods to apply these techniques have not yet been reported. Elevating P4 before the timed AI generally decreases double ovulation and increases fertility to the timed AI. Near the time of AI, slight elevations in circulating P4, possibly due to inadequate luteal regression, can dramatically reduce fertility. After AI, circulating P4 is critical for embryo growth and establishment and maintenance of pregnancy. Many studies have attempted to improve fertility by elevating P4 after timed AI. Our recent meta-analysis and manipulative study indicated small fertility benefits (3% to 3.5%) mostly in primiparous cows. Thus, previous research has provided substantial insight into mechanisms regulating circulating P4 concentrations and actions.

Most health disorders occur during this time. Compared with other stages of the lactation cycle, relatively little is known about fundamental biological processes during the transition period. The regulation and coordination of lipid metabolism among adipose tissue, liver, gut, and mammary gland are key components of the adaptations to lactation. Lipid accumulation in liver may contribute to health disorders and decreased milk production. Knowledge of key control points in hepatic metabolism of long-chain fatty acids is lacking, as is an understanding of the metabolic effects of hormones, growth factors, and cytokines that mediate stress. Recent evidence indicates that supplemental fats or restricted intakes before parturition can induce a coordinated set of metabolic changes in metabolism of long-chain fatty acids, including peroxisomal beta-oxidation, perhaps mediated by peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors. Estimates of the mixture of fuels constituting metabolizable energy in cows during the early postpartum period suggest that supply of amino acids and glucogenic compounds may be under proposed optima, whereas ketogenic and lipogenic compounds and long-chain fatty acids may be in excess. Because dietary fat does not suppress body lipid mobilization, during the early postpartum period supplemental fat may further imbalance the mixture of fuels and lead to decreased dry matter intake. Increased understanding of the biology of the transition period should decrease health problems and increase profitability of dairy cows.", "year": 1999, "openAccessPdf": null, "authors": [{"authorId": "4566707", "name": "J.

The cows were from 14 herds and had calved between January 1, 1994 and December 31, 1994; all cows were followed until September 30, 1995. Survival analysis was performed using the Cox proportional hazards model to incorporate time-dependent covariates for diseases. Different intervals representing stages of lactation were considered for effects of the diseases. Five models were fitted to test how milk yield and conception status modified the effect of diseases on culling. Covariates in the models included parity, calving season, and time-dependent covariates measuring diseases, milk yield of the current lactation, and conception status. Data were stratified by herd. The seven diseases and lactational risks under consideration were milk fever (0.9%), retained placenta (9.5%), displaced abomasum (5.3%), ketosis (5.0%), metritis (4.2%), ovarian cysts (10.6%), and mastitis (14.5%). Older cows were at a much higher risk of being culled. Calving season had no effect on culling. Higher milk yield was protective against culling. Once a cow had conceived again, her risk of culling dropped sharply. In all models, mastitis was an important risk factor throughout lactation. Milk fever, retained placenta, displaced abomasum, ketosis, and ovarian cysts also significantly affected culling at different stages of lactation. Metritis had no effect on culling. The magnitude of the effects of the diseases decreased, but remained important, when milk yield and conception status were included as covariates.

In addition to metabolic disease, the overwhelming majority of infectious disease, in particular mastitis, becomes clinically apparent during the first 2 wk of lactation. Three basic physiological functions must be maintained during the periparturient period if disease is to be avoided: adaptation of the rumen to lactation diets that are high in energy density, maintenance of normocalcemia, and maintenance of a strong immune system.

Data were generated from a pseudo-normal distribution to test this theory for estimates derived from parent-offspring correlation and paternal sib correlation.

About 11% of parturitions of primiparous Holstein cows result in the death of a calf; 5.7% in multiparous cows. Genetic evaluations can be reported as perinatal survival to 48 h to emphasize the positive information about the trait. The purpose of this research was to: 1) estimate genetic parameters by restricted maximum likelihood for perinatal survival rates; 2) characterize the genetic evaluation of sires for the perinatal survival of their progeny and maternal grandsires for the perinatal survival of their daughters progeny; and 3) estimate genetic trends from 1984 to 1994. Data (n = 666,339) were from the National Association of Animal Breeders calving ease database. Over 600 new young sires were available each year. The binomial response variable, 1 = alive, 0 = stillborn within 48 h of parturition was analyzed by using a sire-maternal grandsire linear mixed model. The model included fixed effects for sex of calf, dystocia, and season of birth, and gestation length as a covariate; correlated random effects of sire and maternal grandsire; and uncorrelated random effects of herd-years. Parturitions of primiparous and multiparous cows were analyzed separately. In primiparous cows, heritability estimates were 1.1 and 2.2% for sire of the calf and maternal grandsire, respectively. The genetic correlation between sire and maternal grandsire predicted transmitting ability (PTA) for perinatal survival, was 0.31; simple product moment correlations among sire-MGS PTA were 0.43 and 0.46 for primiparous and multiparous cows, respectively. The PTA for sire of the calf ranged from -2.9 (lower survival) to 2.8% (higher survival). Mean PTA from 1984 to 1994 was quite variable from year to year. Evidence showed a slightly negative, but nonsignificant, genetic trend in perinatal survival (-0.04% per year for sires and -0.02% per year for maternal grandsires).

Increased production has been associated with reduced conception rates (66% in 1951 versus 40 to 50% since 1975). Because conception rate in dairy heifers has remained higher, the metabolic demands of higher production may be related to the decline in reproductive performance in cows. During early lactation, increasing dietary intake fails to keep pace with rising milk production. The resultant negative energy balance and rate of mobilization of body reserves appear directly related to the postpartum interval to first ovulation and lower conception rate. Delays in the onset of normal ovarian activity, thus limiting the number of estrous cycles before breeding, may account for the observed decrease in fertility. Negative energy balance probably acts similarly to undernutrition and may manifest in delayed ovarian activity by impinging on pulsatile secretion of LH. Lower availability of glucose and insulin may also decrease LH pulsatility or limit ovarian responsiveness to gonadotropins. Alternatively, release of endogenous opioids in association with increasing feed intake or other lactational hormone responses may provide neural or pituitary inhibition of the pulsatile LH production that is requisite for ovarian follicular development.", "year": 1989, "openAccessPdf": null, "authors": [{"authorId": "143999219", "name": "W.

On a herd basis the condition can adversely affect milk yield and fertility, but on an individual cow basis the effects are unpredictable. The aetiology of retained placenta has been extensively studied and many causal factors have been implicated, but little is known of how many of them cause the condition. As a result its prevention and prediction is uncertain, primarily because of the lack of knowledge of the normal process of placental release. Vascular changes and uterine contractions play a role in placental release, but current opinion suggests that the primary cause of retained placenta is the retention of the feto-maternal union. Release only occurs after a process of maturation, which involves hormonal and structural changes.

Other frequently used fertility characteristics, like days open or calving intervals, could easily be derived from the analyzed traits. Data included 94,250 records in parities 1 to 6 on 53,158 cows from Ontario and Quebec, born in the years 1997 to 2002. Reproductive characteristics of heifers and cows were treated as different but genetically correlated traits that gave 16 total traits in the analysis.

Service sire, sire of calf, and artificial insemination technician were important (relative to additive genetic) sources of variation for nonreturn rate and traits related to calving performance.

The mean intervals from calving to first service and conception were prolonged (p<0.05) by 7 and 18 days, respectively, in the group with retained placentas compared to the control group. These results suggest that abnormal partus and gestation length are strongly correlated with the development of retained placenta, which increases the occurrence of postpartum diseases and subsequently decreases reproductive performance in dairy herds.", "year": 2005, "openAccessPdf": {"url": "http://synapse.koreamed.org/Synapse/Data/PDFData/0118JVS/jvs-6-53.pdf", "status": "GOLD"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "78517687", "name": "I.

The major objective was to introduce guidelines and standards for the recording and presentation of the diseases of dairy cattle. Eight clinically identifiable diseases of economic importance to the dairy industry were considered: milk fever, retained placenta, metritis, ketosis, left displaced abomasum, cystic ovarian disease, lameness, and clinical mastitis. Standardized definitions for these diseases were established through consultation with industry partners. Two approaches to summarization and reporting were proposed. For retrospective analysis, which is used when historical data are summarized for genetic evaluation for example, lactational incidence risk (cumulative incidence) has been recommended. For current analysis, which is used for herd health monitoring, a true incidence rate has been recommended. Milk fever and retained placenta were exceptions to the latter because of their short periods of risk. For these two diseases, lactational incidence risks are reported.", "year": 1998, "openAccessPdf": null, "authors": [{"authorId": "6921583", "name": "D. Kelton"}, {"authorId": "10068536", "name": "K.

One theory suggests the fetal placenta must be recognized as \"foreign\" tissue and rejected by the immune system after parturition to cause expulsion of the placenta. We hypothesized that impaired neutrophil function causes retained placenta (RP). We examined the ability of neutrophils to recognize fetal cotyledon tissue as assessed by a chemotaxis assay, which utilized a placental homogenate obtained from a spontaneously expelled placenta as the chemoattractant. Neutrophil killing ability was also estimated by determining myeloperoxidase activity in isolated neutrophils. Blood samples were obtained from 142 periparturient dairy cattle in two herds. Twenty cattle developed RP (14.1%). Neutrophils isolated from blood of cows with RP had significantly lower neutrophil function in both assays before calving, and this impaired function lasted for 1 to 2 wk after parturition. The addition of antibody directed against interleukin-8 (IL-8) to the cotyledon preparation used as a chemoattractant inhibited chemotaxis by 41%, suggesting that one of the chemoattractants present in the cotyledon at parturition is IL-8. At calving, plasma IL-8 concentration was lower in RP cows (51 +/- 12 pg/ml) than in cows expelling the placenta normally (134 +/- 11 pg/ml). From these data, we suggest that neutrophil function is a determining factor for the development of RP in dairy cattle. Also, depressed production of IL-8 may be a factor affecting neutrophil function in cows developing RP.", "year": 2002, "openAccessPdf": null, "authors": [{"authorId": "40222051", "name": "K.

To eliminate the dependence on detection of estrus, we have recently developed a timed artificial insemination (AI) protocol that synchronized the time of ovulation using GnRH and PGF2 alpha. The effectiveness of this protocol as a management tool was compared with standard reproductive management. Lactating dairy cows (n = 333) from three herds were randomly assigned at parturition to two groups. Control cows were managed according to the typical reproductive strategy of the farm that relied on detection of estrus, the a.m.-p.m. breeding rule, and periodic use of PGF2 alpha. Treated cows had timed AI after synchronization of ovulation with GnRH and PGF2 alpha. For both groups, the voluntary waiting period was 50 d postpartum. Pregnancy diagnosis was performed by ultrasound between 32 and 38 d post-AI. Nonpregnant cows were inseminated again using the original treatment until diagnosed as pregnant or until culled from the herd. Median days to first AI (54 vs. 83) and days open (99 vs. 118) were lower for treated cows than for control cows, respectively. Pregnancy rates for the first AI were similar (37% vs. 39%) for the two groups even though treated cows were bred at an earlier time postpartum. More treated cows than control cows were pregnant at 60 d (37% vs. 5%) and at 100 d (53% vs. 35%) after calving. Thus, this protocol allowed effective management of AI in lactating dairy cows without the need for estrus detection.", "year": 1997, "openAccessPdf": null, "authors": [{"authorId": "50139264", "name": "J.

Ovaries of cows [n = 267; >50 days in milk (DIM)] were evaluated weekly using ultrasound to determine spontaneous (i.e., no hormonal treatment) ovulation rate starting at 50 DIM and continuing until pregnancy diagnosis. Cows were fitted with a transmitter to record standing activity during estrus, and serum progesterone concentration was assessed weekly starting at wk 1 postpartum for all cows. Overall, 76 (28.5%) cows were anovular and 191 (71.5%) were ovular by 71 DIM. Incidence of anovulation was not associated with level of milk production but was associated with lower body condition. For anovular cows (n = 41) that spontaneously recovered, the multiple ovulation rate at first ovulation was 46.3%. For second and subsequent ovulations (n = 463), the level of milk production for 14 d preceding estrus was associated with increased ovulation rate. To illustrate, incidence of multiple ovulations was 1.6% (2/128), 16.9% (32/189), and 47.9% (70/146) for ovulations when cows were producing <35, 35 to <45, and >or=45 kg/d, respectively. Among cows for which estrous behavior was recorded, those with multiple ovulations (n = 48) had shorter duration of estrus (4.3 +/- 0.7 vs. 9.9 +/- 0.5 h) and higher production (47.2 +/- 0.9 vs. 38.1 +/- 0.5 kg/d) than cows with single ovulations (n = 237).

In summary, the first spontaneous ovulation in anovular cows and a higher level of milk production for 14 d preceding estrus were associated with increased multiple ovulation rate.

In dairy operations, twinning is an undesirable trait associated with other reproductive and metabolic diseases, higher operational costs, and higher rates of culling on farm. The animal welfare and economic impacts have resulted in the development of a genomic prediction for twinning (i.e., TWIN) by Zoetis such that producers can make informed breeding decisions for breeding Holstein females that are less likely to become pregnant with twins in a given lactation. This prediction is included in a holistic breeding tool (i.e., selection index) for producers so that they can improve multiple health, fertility, and production traits in parallel with reducing twinning when making breeding decisions for future generations. The objectives of the present study were (1) to describe how the twinning prediction was developed (and included in a selection index), (2) show that the prediction works effectively using real life farm data, and (3) propose how this genetic tool can be used in collaboration with management practices to proactively reduce twin pregnancies on farm. The results of this study provide evidence that twinning can be proactively managed on dairy farms using genetically powered tools. Abstract Twinning is a multifactorial trait influenced by both genetic and environmental factors that can negatively impact animal welfare and economic sustainability on commercial dairy operations. To date, using genetic selection as a tool for reducing twinning rates on commercial dairies has been proposed, but not yet implemented. In response to this market need, Zoetis (Kalamazoo, MI, USA) has developed a genomic prediction for twin pregnancies, and included it in a comprehensive multitrait selection index. The objectives of this study were to (1) describe a genetic evaluation for twinning in Holstein cattle, (2) demonstrate the efficacy of the predictions, (3) propose strategies to reduce twin pregnancies using this information. Data were retrieved from commercial dairies and provided directly by producers upon obtaining their permission. The twin pregnancies trait (TWIN) was defined as a pregnancy resulting in birth or abortion of twin calves, classified as a binary (0,1) event, and analysed using a threshold animal model. Predictions for a subset of cows were compared to their on-farm twin records. The heritability for twin pregnancies was 0.088, and genomic predicted transmitting abilities ((g)PTAs) ranged from \u22127.45\u201320.79. Genetic correlations between TWIN and other traits were low, meaning that improvement for TWIN will not negatively impact improvement for other traits. TWIN was effectively demonstrated to identify cows most and least likely to experience a twin pregnancy in a given lactation, regardless of reproductive protocol used. Effective inclusion of the prediction in a multitrait selection index offers producers a comprehensive tool to inform selection and management decisions. When combined with sound management practices, this presents a compelling opportunity for dairy producers to proactively reduce the incidence of twin pregnancies on commercial dairy operations.", "year": 2021, "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://www.mdpi.com/2076-2615/11/3/843/pdf?version=1616127711", "status": "GOLD"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2060338920", "name": "S.

Algorithms were derived and computer programs tested with simulated data for 2,967 bulls and 50,000 markers distributed randomly across 30 chromosomes. Estimation of genomic inbreeding coefficients required accurate estimates of allele frequencies in the base population. Linear model predictions of breeding values were computed by 3 equivalent methods: 1) iteration for individual allele effects followed by summation across loci to obtain estimated breeding values, 2) selection index including a genomic relationship matrix, and 3) mixed model equations including the inverse of genomic relationships. A blend of first- and second-order Jacobi iteration using 2 separate relaxation factors converged well for allele frequencies and effects. Reliability of predicted net merit for young bulls was 63% compared with 32% using the traditional relationship matrix. Nonlinear predictions were also computed using iteration on data and nonlinear regression on marker deviations; an additional (about 3%) gain in reliability for young bulls increased average reliability to 66%. Computing times increased linearly with number of genotypes. Estimation of allele frequencies required 2 processor days, and genomic predictions required <1 d per trait, and traits were processed in parallel. Information from genotyping was equivalent to about 20 daughters with phenotypic records.

Cows (n=92) from 1 commercial dairy operation were used in this study. Periparturient dairy cows (primiparous, n=58; multiparous, n=34) were placed in a maternity pen and constantly monitored until birth. The calving ease of cows, time from AS or feet appearance to birth, calving progress from a subset of 15 cows (frequency and duration of abdominal contractions during labor), calf birth weight, calf sex, and stillbirths (born dead or died within 24h after birth) were recorded. The reference times for obstetric intervention during dystocia were estimated based on values from unassisted births (normal). The normal range of times from the appearance of AS or feet outside the vulva to birth was estimated based on the mean+2 standard deviations (SD) of unassisted births. According to farm protocol, assistance was provided to cows without calving progress 80 min after AS appearance or earlier (e.g., to correct malpositions). Cows with dystocic births had a longer time from AS appearance to birth and increased incidence of stillbirth compared with cows with eutocic calvings. After the appearance of the AS, calving progress was evident every 15 min for eutocic births. The estimated reference times (mean+2 SD) from AS appearance to birth were 69.7 min and from feet appearance to birth were 64.6 min for eutocic births. Findings from this study suggested that calving personnel should start assisting cows 70 min after AS appearance (or 65 min after feet appearance) outside the vulva. The time spent in labor (straining) combined with the time from the appearance of the AS or feet to birth, and the assessment of calving progress (as described for eutocic births) should be used as guidelines for obstetric intervention during difficult births under field conditions.

The chart consists of text and diagrams that detail changes in conformation with body condition change for eight body locations identified as important in body condition scoring. The precision with which a prototype chart was used to give location specific condition scores to cows was examined, and the variability among the assessors described. This chart gave consistent results with small variability among assessors, no significant difference attributable to experience of assessors, and no significant cow assessor interaction. Minor modifications were made to the chart, which was then used to assess location specific and overall body condition scores. Assessors scored cows in the eight body locations and rescored the cows in a different order to assign an overall score. The chart produced consistent scores over a wide range of body conditions with small variance among assessors. The overall score was most closely related to the condition scores of the pelvic and tailhead areas of the cow. Both location specific scores within cows and the overall body score for a cow were strongly correlated, demonstrating that the chart was internally consistent. The chart is an effective field tool for body condition scoring Holstein cows.", "year": 1989, "openAccessPdf": null, "authors": [{"authorId": "36363741", "name": "A.

The cow value, its related values of a new pregnancy and a pregnancy loss, and their associated replacement policies determine profitability in dairy farming. One objective of this study was to present a simple, interactive, dynamic, and robust formulation of the cow value and the replacement problem, including expectancy of the future production of the cow and the genetic gain of the replacement. The proven hypothesis of this study was that all the above requirements could be achieved by using a Markov chain algorithm. The Markov chain model allowed (1) calculation of a forward expected value of a studied cow and its replacement; (2) use of a single model (the Markov chain) to calculate both the replacement policies and the herd statistics; (3) use of a predefined, preestablished farm reproductive replacement policy; (4) inclusion of a farmer's assessment of the expected future performance of a cow; (5) inclusion of a farmer's assessment of genetic gain with a replacement; and (6) use of a simple spreadsheet or an online system to implement the decision support system. Results clearly demonstrated that the decision policies found with the Markov chain model were consistent with more complex dynamic programming models. The final user-friendly decision support tool is available at http://dairymgt.info/ \u2192 Tools \u2192 The Economic Value of a Dairy Cow. This tool calculates the cow value instantaneously and is highly interactive, dynamic, and robust. When a Wisconsin dairy farm was studied using the model, the solution policy called for replacing nonpregnant cows 11 mo after calving or months in milk (MIM) if in the first lactation and 9 MIM if in later lactations. The cow value for an average second-lactation cow was as follows: (1) when nonpregnant, (a) $897 in MIM = 1 and (b) $68 in MIM = 8; (2) when the cow just became pregnant,(a) $889 for a pregnancy in MIM = 3 and (b) $298 for a pregnancy in MIM = 8; and (3) the value of a pregnancy loss when a cow became pregnant in MIM = 5 was (a) $221 when the loss was in the first month of pregnancy and (b) $897 when the loss was in the ninth month of pregnancy. The cow value indicated pregnant cows should be kept. The expected future production of a cow with respect to a similar average cow was an important determinant in the cow replacement decision. The expected production in the rest of the lactation was more important for nonpregnant cows, and the expected production in successive lactations was more important for pregnant cows. A 120% expected milk production for a cow with MIM = 16 and 6 mo pregnant in the present lactation or in successive lactations determined between 1.52 and 6.48 times the cow value, respectively, of an average production cow. The cow value decreased by $211 for every 1 percentage point of expected genetic gain of the replacement. A break-even analysis of the cow value with respect to expected milk production of an average second-parity cow indicated that (1) nonpregnant cows in MIM = 1 and 8 could still remain in the herd if they produced at least 84 and 98% in the present lactation or if they produced at least 78 and 97% in future lactations, respectively; and (2) cows becoming pregnant in MIM = 5 would require at least 64% of milk production in the rest of the lactation or 93% in successive lactations to remain in the herd.", "year": 2012, "openAccessPdf": {"url": "http://www.journalofdairyscience.org/article/S0022030212004572/pdf", "status": "HYBRID"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2238820528", "name": "Victor E.

The overall incidence rate of PL was 6.9% in 1,001 pregnant cows and its incidence peaked (p < 0.01) during the second trimester of gestation. GLIMMIX analysis revealed that cow parity was the important risk factor for the PL. The odds ratio showed that the likelihood of PL in cows with parities of 1 or 2 was decreased by 0.6 or 0.5 fold compared to the cows with a parity of 3 or higher. Following PL, the mean rate of endometritis was 23.2% and endometritis was more common (p < 0.05) when PL occurred during the third trimester than during the first and second trimesters. The mean culling rate was 46.4% and this did not differ with the period of PL. The overall mean intervals from PL to the first service and conception were 63.4 and 101.8 days, respectively. The mean interval from PL to first service was longer (p < 0.01) for cows with PL during the third trimester than for the cows with PL during the first and second trimesters. The economic loss resulting from each PL was estimated at approximately $2,333, and this was largely due to an extended calving interval and increased culling.

Reproductive data were recorded until 200 d after parturition. Diagnostic criteria for cytological and clinical endometritis were determined based on detrimental effect on subsequent reproductive performance, using logistic regression and Cox proportional hazard models accounting for the effect of herd clustering. Comparison of diagnostic criteria was performed using endometrial cytology as reference test or by quantifying the agreement between diagnostic approaches. At exam 1, diagnostic criteria were \u22656% polymorphonuclear cells and mucopurulent or worse (purulent or foul) vaginal discharge for cytological and clinical endometritis, respectively. At exam 2, diagnostic criteria were \u22654% polymorphonuclear cells and mucopurulent or worse vaginal discharge for cytological and clinical endometritis, respectively. Cows were classified as having cytological endometritis only, clinical endometritis only, or both cytological and clinical endometritis. Prevalence at exam 1 was 13.5, 9.4, and 5.8% for cytological endometritis only, clinical endometritis only, and both cytological and clinical endometritis, respectively. The detrimental effects of cytological and clinical endometritis on reproductive performance were additive. Among cows with clinical endometritis, only 38 and 36% had cytological endometritis at exam 1 and exam 2, respectively. Combination of diagnostic criteria improved neither the accuracy for predicting cytological endometritis nor the agreement between cytological and clinical endometritis. Overall, these results suggested that cytological and clinical endometritis may represent different manifestations of reproductive tract disease. They also suggested that use of the terminology clinical endometritis may not be accurate and that purulent vaginal discharge may be more descriptive.", "year": 2010, "openAccessPdf": {"url": "http://www.journalofdairyscience.org/article/S0022030210005631/pdf", "status": "HYBRID"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "144785426", "name": "J.

Infection with Escherichia coli, Arcanobacterium pyogenes, and bovine herpesvirus 4 causes endometrial tissue damage. Toll-like receptors on endometrial cells detect pathogen-associated molecules such as bacterial DNA, lipids, and lipopolysaccharide (LPS), leading to secretion of cytokines, chemokines, and antimicrobial peptides. Chemokines attract neutrophils and macrophages to eliminate the bacteria, although persistence of neutrophils is associated with subclinical endometritis and infertility. Cows with uterine infections are less likely to ovulate because they have slower growth of the postpartum dominant follicle in the ovary, lower peripheral plasma estradiol concentrations, and perturbation of hypothalamic and pituitary function. The follicular fluid of animals with endometritis contains LPS, which is detected by the TLR4/CD14/LY96 (MD2) receptor complex on granulosa cells, leading to lower aromatase expression and reduced estradiol secretion. If cows with uterine disease ovulate, the peripheral plasma concentrations of progesterone are lower than those in normal animals. However, luteal phases are often extended in animals with uterine disease, probably because infection switches the endometrial epithelial secretion of prostaglandins from the F series to the E series by a phospholipase A2-mediated mechanism, which would disrupt luteolysis. The regulation of endometrial immunity depends on steroid hormones, somatotrophins, and local regulatory proteins. Advances in knowledge about infection and immunity in the female genital tract should be exploited to develop new therapeutics for uterine disease.", "year": 2009, "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://academic.oup.com/biolreprod/article-pdf/81/6/1025/10571685/biolreprod1025.pdf", "status": "BRONZE"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2241532641", "name": "I.

The case definition of endometritis was the presence of purulent uterine discharge or cervical diameter > 7.5 cm, or the presence of muco-purulent discharge after 26 DIM. There were 316 cows with endometritis from 27 farms assigned randomly within herd to receive 500 mg of cephapirin benzathine intrauterine (i.u.), 500 micrograms of cloprostenol i.m., or no treatment. The rate of resolution of clinical signs 14 d after treatment was 77% and was not affected by treatment. Reproductive performance was monitored for a minimum of 7 mo after treatment. Survival analysis (multivariable proportional hazards regression) was used to measure the effect of treatment on time to pregnancy. There was no benefit of treatment of endometritis before 4 wk postpartum.

Swabs were collected from the uterine body lumen of cattle on days 7, 14, 21 and 28 after parturition. Bacteria were identified by aerobic and anaerobic culture; bacterial growth was scored semiquantitatively and animals were categorized into standard or high bacterial contamination categories on the basis of the number of colonies detected. Follicular growth and function were monitored by daily transrectal ultrasonography, and estimation of plasma FSH, oestradiol and progesterone concentrations. There was no effect of bacterial contamination on plasma FSH concentration profiles or emergence of the ovarian follicle wave.

Defined endocrine parameters such as interval to post-partum commencement of luteal activity, inter-ovulatory interval and length of luteal and inter-luteal intervals were used with a number of traditional measures of reproductive performance to investigate the current status of fertility in a sample of United Kingdom dairy herds. A comparison of the results of the 1995 to 1998 trial with those of a previous (1975 to 1982) milk progesterone database, which included 2503 lactations in British Friesian cows monitored using a similar milk sampling protocol, revealed a decline infertility between these periods. Between 1975-1982 and 1995-1998, pregnancy rate to first service declined from 55\u00b76% to 39\u00b77% (P < 0\u00b7001), at a derived average rate approaching 1% per year. This decline was associated with an increase (P < 0\u00b7001) in the proportion of animals with one or more atypical ovarian hormone patterns from 32% to 44%. There was a significant (P < 0\u00b7001) increase in the incidence of delayed luteolysis during the first cycle post partum (delayed luteolysis type I; 7\u00b73% to 18\u00b72%) and during subsequent cycles (delayed luteolysis type II; 6\u00b74% to 16\u00b78%), although the incidence of prolonged anovulation post part\u016fm (delayed ovulation type I; 10\u00b79% to 12\u00b79%) and prolonged inter-luteal intervals (delayed ovulation type II; 12\u00b79% to 10\u00b76%) did not alter significantly.

To clarify this controversy, the pattern of growth and regression of ovarian follicles was characterized during a complete estrous cycle in ten heifers by daily ultrasonographic examinations. Follicles greater than or equal to 5 mm were measured and their relative locations within the ovary were determined in order to follow the sequential development of each individual follicle. Results indicated the presence of either two (n = 2 heifers), three (n = 7), or four (n = 1) waves of follicular growth per cycle. Each wave was characterized by the development of one large (dominant) follicle and a variable number of smaller (non-dominant) follicles. In the most common pattern observed (three waves/cycle), the first, second, and third waves started on Days 1.9 +/- 0.3, 9.4 +/- 0.5, and 16.1 +/- 0.7 (X +/- SEM), respectively. The dominant follicle in the third wave was the ovulatory follicle. The maximal size and the growth rate of the dominant follicle in the second wave were significantly lower than in the other waves, but no significant difference was observed between the first and third waves. For the two heifers that had two follicular waves/cycle, the waves started on Days 2 and 11, whereas in the remaining heifer (four waves/cycle), the waves began on Days 2, 8, 14, and 17, respectively. At 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 days before estrus, the ovulatory follicle was the largest follicle in the ovaries in 100%, 95%, 74%, 35%, and 25% of follicular phases monitored, respectively. The relative size of the preovulatory follicle at the completion of luteolysis (progesterone less than 1 ng/ml) was negatively correlated (r = -0.90; p less than 0.0001) with the interval of time between the end of luteolysis and the luteinizing hormone surge, suggesting that the length of proestrus is determined by the size of the pre-ovulatory follicle at the beginning of proestrus.

An additional 10 cows calved before administration of a corticoid treatment was performed. The 20 mg dosage of dexamethasone caused parturition within 72 hr. in 159 of 189 cows. All higher dosages of dexamethasone (30, 50 or 60 mg) and the 7.5 mg dosage of flumethasone caused parturition within 72 hr. in all animals treated. Placental retention occurred in 159 of the 294 treated cows and none of the 10 untreated cows. Intramuscular treatment of cows with a retained placenta with 4 million units penicillin and 5 g streptomycin resulted in good post-partum recovery and subsequent normal fertility. Mean services per conception was 1.23 for retained placenta animals and 1.35 for animals that did not retain the placenta. The calving interval was 365 days following the induced parturition. There was a significant correlation (r=.271, P < 0.01) of birth weight with day of pregnancy at parturition over all breeds. Within individual breeds, only the cross-bred females failed to show a similar correlation. The average increase in calf birth weight per day of gestation length ranged from 1.20 lb. (.545 kg) for Angus females to 0.28 lb. (.129 kg) for cross-bred females and averaged 0.94 lb./day, (.428 kg/ day) for all animals. These data were based on calving at days 267 to 285 of gestation.

For heifers, beef and moderate yielding dairy cows, does and camelids it appears that fertilization generally lies between 90% and 100%. In high-producing dairy cows there is a less substantive body of literature, but it would appear that it is somewhat lower and perhaps more variable. In cattle, the major component of embryo loss occurs before day 16 following breeding with some evidence of greater losses before day 8 in high-producing dairy cows. In cattle late embryo loss, while numerically much smaller than early embryo mortality loss, nevertheless, causes serious economic losses to producers because it is often too late to rebreed females when they repeat. In multiple ovulating small ruminants, the loss rate is positively related to ovulation rate. Systemic concentrations of progesterone, during both the cycle preceding and following insemination, affect embryo survival rate with evidence that too high or indeed too low a concentration being negatively associated with survival rate. Uterine expression of mRNA for progesterone receptor, oestradiol receptor and retinol-binding protein appears to be sensitive to changes in peripheral concentrations of progesterone during the first week after artificial insemination. Energy balance and dry matter intake during 4 weeks after calving are critically important in determining conception rate when cows are inseminated at 70-100 days post-calving. Concentrate supplementation of cows at pasture during the breeding period has minimal effects on conception rates though sudden reductions in dietary intake should be avoided. For all systems of milk production, more balanced breeding strategies with greater emphasis on fertility and feed intake and/or energy balance must be developed. There is sufficient genetic variability within the Holstein breed for fertility traits. Alternative dairy breeds such as the Jersey or Norwegian Red could also be utilized. Genomic technology will not only provide scientists with an improved understanding of the underlying biological processes involved in fertilization and the establishment of pregnancy, but also, in the future, identify genes responsible for improved embryo survival. Its incorporation into breeding objectives would increase the rate of genetic progress for embryo survival.", "year": 2008, "openAccessPdf": null, "authors": [{"authorId": "4603191", "name": "M.

Some of this decline is attributed to the negative genetic correlation between milk production and reproduction. In the United States, yearly production per cow has increased steadily at a rate of 1.3% in the last decade and it is likely that this trend will continue in the years to come. At this rate, the average cow in the United States will be producing over 14 tons of milk per year in 2050 and technologies will have to be developed to allow these cows to reproduce to maintain the sustainability of dairy production. Despite high production, it is not uncommon for dairy herds with rolling herd averages for milk yield above 11,000 kg to overcome the challenges of reproduction and obtain satisfactory reproductive performance. Among other things, those herds have been able to mitigate some of the mechanisms that suppress reproduction in dairy cows such as extended postpartum anovulatory period, poor estrous detection, low pregnancy per insemination and, to a lesser extent, the high pregnancy loss. The success of those farms comes from an integrated approach to fertility that includes adequate cow comfort, elaborated transition cow management and nutrition, aggressive postpartum health monitoring program with preventative and curative measures to mitigate the negative effects of diseases on reproduction, and a sound reproductive program that includes manipulation of the ovarian cycle to allow for increased insemination rate. More recently, introduction of fertility traits in selection programs have created new opportunities for improved reproduction without neglecting economically important production traits.", "year": 2010, "openAccessPdf": {"url": "http://www.biosciproceedings.org/bp/0007/pdf/bp0007rdr28.pdf", "status": "GOLD"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2217236762", "name": "Jep Santos"}, {"authorId": "2230027306", "name": "R.

However, substantial pregnancy loss occurs within the first 60 d of gestation in cattle, and these losses have a profound adverse economic impact on the dairy and beef cattle industries. Detecting these impending pregnancy losses could offer producers an opportunity to reduce costs associated with this source of reproductive inefficiency. Several of the pregnancy diagnostic tools currently available and new technologies are being examined for their ability to predict pregnancies at risk for failing in early pregnancy. This review provides a synopsis of work undertaken recently to predict pregnancy losses in cattle. Currently, opportunities to predict pregnancy loss include (1) using transrectal ultrasonography to detect loss of the fetal heartbeat, floating debris within the placental fluids, and reductions in fetal size; (2) observing reductions in circulating progesterone concentrations; (3) detecting reductions in concentrations of circulating placental products; namely, pregnancy-associated glycoproteins and microRNAs; and (4) detecting reductions in the early pregnancy-dependent increase in interferon-stimulatory gene expression in peripheral blood leukocytes. An achievable goal may be to identify markers of embryo mortality so that researchers and clinicians can focus their efforts on developing intervention strategies for cows identified to be at risk for pregnancy failure.", "year": 2019, "openAccessPdf": {"url": "http://www.journalofdairyscience.org/article/S0022030219308719/pdf", "status": "HYBRID"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "4542417", "name": "A.

Lactating dairy cows (n=1,754) from 3 seasonal grazing farms were blocked within farm by breed, parity, and days in milk (DIM). Study d 0 was considered the day of AI of cows in COS72 (72h of proestrus). Within each block, cows were randomly assigned to 1 of 2 presynchronization treatments: a PGF(2\u03b1)-based program, Presynch, consisting of 2 injections of PGF(2\u03b1) administered on d -32 and -18, or a PGF(2\u03b1)-GnRH-based program, Double-Ovsynch (DO), consisting of GnRH on d -25, PGF(2\u03b1) on d -18, and GnRH on d -15. Within each of the 2 presynchronization treatments, cows were randomly assigned to 1 of 2 lengths of proestrus within the 5-d timed AI protocol, consisting of GnRH on d -8, PGF(2\u03b1) on d -3 and -2, and GnRH+AI at either 58 h (COS58) or 72 h (COS72) after the d -3 PGF(2\u03b1) injection. Ovaries were scanned by ultrasonography twice, on d -42 and -32, to determine estrous cyclicity before enrollment in the study. Blood was sampled and analyzed for concentrations of estradiol on the day of AI. Pregnancies per AI (P/AI) were determined 30 and 65 d after AI. Presynchronization did not affect the concentration of estradiol at AI (DO=6.4 vs. Presynch=5.8 pg/mL), detection of estrus at AI (20.8 vs. 25.9%), or P/AI on d 30 (56.8 vs. 59.1%) and 65 (52.5 vs. 52.4%) after the first AI. Cows receiving COS72 had increased concentration of estradiol (6.6 vs. 5.5 pg/mL) and detection of estrus at AI (28.5 vs. 10.8%) compared with cows receiving COS58. Length of proestrus did not affect P/AI on d 30 (COS72=58.7 vs. COS58=56.1%) but, in Presynch cows, COS58 was detrimental to fertility on d 65 after AI (54.9 vs. 46.5%). Pregnancy loss between gestational d 30 and 65 was greater for Presynch than for DO (7.6 vs. 11.3%), but it was not affected by length of proestrus.

Crossbred Holstein/Jersey cows had superior fertility than their purebred counterparts during the breeding season. The Presynch and DO protocols resulted in similar fertility with no overall difference between the presynchronization methods; however, limiting the length of proestrus to 58 h reduced P/AI in the 5-d timed AI protocol when cows had their estrous cycle presynchronized with Presynch but not with DO.", "year": 2012, "openAccessPdf": {"url": "http://www.journalofdairyscience.org/article/S0022030212002172/pdf", "status": "HYBRID"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2233201", "name": "E.

Lactating dairy cows (n = 634) at 6 locations were assigned randomly within lactation number and stage of lactation to receive the Ovsynch protocol [OVS; synchronization of ovulation by injecting GnRH 7 d before and 48 h after PGF(2alpha), followed by one fixed-time AI (TAI) 16 to 20 h after the second GnRH injection] or Ovsynch plus a controlled internal drug release (CIDR) P4-releasing insert for 7 d, beginning at the first GnRH injection (OVS + CIDR). Blood was sampled to quantify P4 10 d before the first GnRH injection, immediately before the first GnRH injection, at the time of CIDR removal, before the PGF(2alpha) injection (1 to 2 h after CIDR insert removal), and 48 h after the PGF(2alpha) injection to determine cyclicity status before initiation of treatment, luteal status at the PGF(2alpha) injection, and incidence of luteal regression. Overall, conception rates at 28 (40 vs. 50%) and 56 d (33 vs. 38%) after TAI differed between OVS and OVS + CIDR, respectively; but a treatment x location interaction was detected. Compared with OVS, pregnancy outcomes were more positive for OVS + CIDR cows at 4 of 6 locations 28 d after TAI and at 3 of 6 locations 56 d after TAI. An interaction of luteal status (high vs. low) before CIDR insert removal and PGF(2alpha) injection with pretreatment cycling status indicated that cows having low P4 at PGF(2alpha) injection benefited most from P4 supplementation (OVS + CIDR = 36% vs. OVS = 18%), regardless of pretreatment cycling status. Pregnancy loss between 28 and 56 d after TAI was greater for noncycling cows (31%) compared with cycling cows (16%). Pregnancy loss for cows receiving P4 (21%) did not differ from that for cows not receiving P4 (21%). Supplementation of P4, pretreatment cycling status, and luteal status before PGF(2alpha) injection altered follicular diameters at the time of the second GnRH injection, but were unrelated to pregnancy outcomes. Incidence of multiple ovulation was greater in noncycling than in cycling cows. Further, cows having multiple ovulations had improved pregnancy outcomes at 28 and 56 d after TAI. In summary, a CIDR insert during the Ovsynch protocol increased fertility in lactating cows having low serum P4 before PGF(2alpha) injection.

As a consequence, interest in manipulation of ovulation rate through this approach has declined and is now focused on immunological manipulation of endogenous inhibin following successful studies in sheep. Studies have concentrated on developing a prototype inhibin-based vaccine to be used for twinning in the Australian beef industry. The prototype vaccine (with recombinant ovine inhibin-alpha.3 fusion protein and Montanide:Marcol adjuvant) has proved to be very potent and control of the degree of ovarian stimulation has not been possible. The proportion of cattle with increased ovulation rate after inhibin immunization is affected by timing of booster vaccination within the ovarian cycle, time after vaccination, vaccine formulation and possibly genotype. Physiological studies show that cattle responding to the inhibin vaccine have increased plasma inhibin binding of native bovine inhibin, high plasma FSH concentrations, greater numbers of large (> or = 8 mm) follicles and fewer small (< 5 mm) follicles during the preovulatory wave of follicular development compared with control or non-responding animals. Significant correlations among the response parameters (i.e. inhibin binding, plasma FSH concentrations, number of large follicles and ovulation rate) have been demonstrated.

In the present study, we evaluated ovarian structures (every 12 h by ultrasonography) and circulating hormones (every 6 h) to determine the differences between cows that developed one (single dominant; n = 16), two (double dominant; n = 8), or three (triple dominant; n = 3) dominant follicles. The four largest follicles were tracked retrospectively, and the data were normalized to the time of expected follicular deviation (F1 \u2265 8.5 mm; hour 0). Follicular dynamics from emergence to deviation were similar, whereas after deviation, expected subordinate follicles continued to grow at a rate similar to the dominant follicle. Triple dominants had greater FSH than double dominants (hour \u221224 to hour \u221212) and single dominants (hour \u221242 to hour \u22126), and double dominants had greater FSH than single dominants (hour \u221224 to hour \u221212). Increased circulating estradiol but lower inhibin were observed in cows that developed multiple follicles. In addition, double dominants had greater LH than single dominants (hour \u221242 to hour \u221224 and hour \u22126 to hour 0) and lower progesterone than single dominants (hour \u221212 and hour \u22126). Luteal volume was similar between groups, but milk production was greater for codominant than for single-dominant cows. Thus, selection of multiple dominant follicles during high milk production is related to a transient increase in circulating FSH and LH during the 24 h before follicular selection, producing continued postdeviation growth of follicles that ordinarily would have regressed. Increased FSH and LH probably result from decreased circulating inhibin and progesterone in cows that develop codominant follicles.", "year": 2005, "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://academic.oup.com/biolreprod/article-pdf/72/4/788/10561420/biolreprod0788.pdf", "status": "BRONZE"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "144187441", "name": "H.

So far, only few signals involved in this dialogue have been identified. In bovine and other ruminants, interferon tau is the predominant embryonic pregnancy recognition signal, exhibiting antiluteolytic activity. However, this is just one aspect of the complex process of embryo-maternal signalling, and a number of other systems are more likely to be involved. To gain a more comprehensive understanding of these important mechanisms, integrated projects involving specialists in embryology, reproductive biotechnology and functional genome research are necessary to perform a systematic analysis of interactions between pre-implantation stage embryos and oviduct or uterine epithelial cells, respectively. State-of-the-art transcriptomic and proteomic technologies will identify reciprocal signals between embryos and their maternal environment and the respective downstream reaction cascades. For in vivo studies, the use of monozygotic twins as recipient animals provides elegant model systems, thus eliminating genetic variability as a cause of differential gene expression. In addition, suitable systems for the co-culture of oviduct epithelial or endometrium cells with the respective embryonic stages need to be established for functional validation of candidate genes potentially involved in the dialogue between embryos and their maternal environment. The knowledge of these mechanisms should help to increase the pregnancy rate following embryo transfer and to avoid embryonic losses. Candidate genes involved in embryo-maternal communication will also be used to define new quality criteria for the selection of embryos for transfer to recipients. Another application is the supplementation of embryotrophic factors or components of embryo-maternal signalling in optimized formulations, such as bioartificial matrices. As a long-term goal, signalling mechanisms identified in bovine will also be functionally evaluated in other species, including the human.", "year": 2003, "openAccessPdf": null, "authors": [{"authorId": "145493807", "name": "E.

A total of 8,095 Holstein cows and 3,635 female offspring born alive on 2 farms using only artificial insemination (AI) were evaluated. Gestation length averaged 276 \u00b1 6 d in the 8,095 dams, and it was categorized as short (SGL; at least 1 SD below the population mean; mean = 266 d, range 256 to 269 d), average (AGL; population mean \u00b1 1 SD; mean = 276 d, range 270 to 282 d), or long (LGL; at least 1 SD above the population mean; mean = 285 d, range 283 to 296 d). Responses evaluated in dams included incidence of diseases within 90 d in milk (DIM), pregnancy at first AI and by 300 DIM, and time to pregnancy. Milk yield and removal from the herd by culling or death were recorded for the first 300 DIM. Responses evaluated in female offspring born alive included removal from the herd and reproductive performance. Within primiparous cows, those with SGL had greater incidence of stillbirth, retained placenta, and metritis than primiparous with AGL or LGL; however, within multiparous cows, those with SGL or LGL had greater incidence of dystocia, stillbirth, retained placenta, and metritis than cows with AGL. Morbidity and rate of morbidity were greater for SGL and LGL than AGL. Rate of removal of dams from the herd was 38% faster for SGL than AGL. Milk production was greatest in AGL cows, but responses depended on parity. For primiparous cows, milk production was less in SGL and LGL than in AGL (AGL = 35.4, SGL = 34.6, LGL = 33.0 \u00b1 0.4 kg/d), whereas for multiparous cows, production was less in SGL but greater in LGL than in AGL (AGL = 41.6, SGL = 38.6, LGL = 42.4 \u00b1 0.3 kg/d). A smaller proportion of cows with SGL received at least one AI, but pregnancy at first AI did not differ among groups. Rate of pregnancy was 11% slower for LGL multiparous than for AGL multiparous. By 300 DIM, pregnancy was greater in AGL than SGL. Pregnancy by 300 DIM in multiparous cows was also greater for AGL than LGL. Heifers from dams with GL that deviated from AGL had greater mortality postweaning (AGL = 3.2 vs. SGL = 6.5 vs. LGL = 5.4%). The rate of removal from the herd was greater for SGL (adjusted hazard ratio = 1.78; 95% CI: 1.26 to 2.52) and LGL (adjusted hazard ratio = 2.00; 95% CI: 1.45 to 2.76) than for AGL heifers. Pregnancy at first AI was lowest for LGL and by 500 d of age a larger proportion of AGL heifers were pregnant than LGL (AGL = 82.3 vs. SGL = 79.2 vs. LGL = 74.0%). Cows with GL within 1 SD of the population mean (270 to 282 d) had improved health, production, and reproduction. Heifers from cows with GL within 1 SD of the population mean had improved health and reproduction.

Consequences of selection on GL were also assessed by examining correlated changes in milk and fitness traits. Holstein bulls with \u2265 300 calvings between 1998 and 2005 were stratified into the following 7 groups using predicted transmitting ability (PTA) for service sire GL: <-3.00, -3.00 to -2.01, \u2026, 1.00 to 1.99, and \u2265 2.00 d. An independent set of 261,598 first-parity cows mated later to the same bulls and calving between 2006 and 2009 were segregated by the service sire PTA GL groups (group had 8,317 to 73,324 gestations), and these mates' GL were examined to determine effectiveness of service sire PTA GL. The model included fixed effects for herd-year and service sire group, plus covariates for conception dates to account for time opportunity among mates. Mean GL for mates by service sire group (from lowest to highest PTA GL) were 275.3, 276.5, 277.8, 278.6, 279.5, 280.6, and 281.7 d. Thus, service sire PTA GL was effective in identifying bulls that modified GL. Subsequent yield and fitness traits were also examined for the (independent) mates with the same service sire groups. Intermediate service sire PTA GL was optimal for yield traits and days open; performance for productive life and culling generally became less favorable as service sire PTA GL increased. A second examination was made by replacing service sire PTA GL groups in the model with phenotypic cow GL groups. Relationships between GL and subsequent performance for milk yield and fitness traits were examined using 9 phenotypic cow GL groups: \u2264 271, 272-273, \u2026, 284-285, and \u2265 286 d. Performance generally improved for subsequent lactation yield as cow GL increased; however, intermediate GL was optimal for productive life, calving ease, stillbirth, culling, and days open. Results indicated that neither shortening nor increasing the mean for GL in the Holstein breed provided much overall benefit when all traits were considered. The same traits examined in the cows for the correlated effect from various GL were also examined in their offspring to determine whether the GL producing the calf had any influence on these same traits when the offspring reached their own productive period. Little carryover occurred from GL on the dam to the other traits observed on the offspring when examined a generation later.", "year": 2011, "openAccessPdf": {"url": "http://www.journalofdairyscience.org/article/S0022030211000476/pdf", "status": "HYBRID"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "143909665", "name": "H.

Because the primary nonevaporative means of cooling for the cow (radiation, conduction, convection) become less effective with rising ambient temperature, the cow becomes increasingly reliant upon evaporative cooling in the form of sweating and panting. High relative humidity compromises evaporative cooling, so that under hot, humid conditions common to the Southeast in summer the dairy cow cannot dissipate sufficient body heat to prevent a rise in body temperature. Increasing air temperature, temperature-humidity index and rising rectal temperature above critical thresholds are related to decreased dry matter intake (DMI) and milk yield and to reduced efficiency of milk yield. Modifications including shade, barns which enhance passive ventilation, and the addition of fans and sprinklers increase body heat loss, lowering body temperature and improving DMI. New technologies including tunnel ventilation are being investigated to determine if they offer cooling advantages. Genetic selection for heat tolerance may be possible, but continued selection for greater performance in the absence of consideration for heat tolerance will result in greater susceptibility to heat stress. The nutritional needs of the cow change during heat stress, and ration reformulation to account for decreased DMI, the need to increase nutrient density, changing nutrient requirements, avoiding nutrient excesses and maintenance of normal rumen function is necessary. Maintaining cow performance in hot, humid climatic conditions in the future will likely require improved cooling capability, continued advances in nutritional formulation, and the need for genetic advancement which includes selection for heat tolerance or the identification of genetic traits which enhance heat tolerance.", "year": 2003, "openAccessPdf": {"url": "http://www.journalofdairyscience.org/article/S002203020373803X/pdf", "status": "HYBRID"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2894408", "name": "J.

Progesterone (P4) was manipulated to reach high (H) or low (L) serum concentrations during the pre-dominance phase (d 0 to 4 of the wave) and dominance phase (d 5 to 7 of the wave) of a second follicular wave ovulatory follicle, creating 4 treatments: H/H, H/L, L/H, and L/L. Luteolysis was induced with PGF2\u03b1 on d 7 of the wave and ovulation was induced with GnRH 56 h after PGF2\u03b1. Cows (n = 558) received artificial insemination (AI) 16 h following GnRH. Pregnancy was determined at 6 intervals during gestation and at calving to quantify pregnancy loss beginning at d 23 post-AI utilizing pregnancy-specific protein B (PSPB) in novel within-cow comparisons. Cows with single ovulations assigned to the L/L treatment had greater pre-ovulatory follicle diameter compared with cows assigned to the L/H or H/L treatments. Cows with single ovulations had greater pre-ovulatory follicle diameter compared with cows with double ovulations. Low P4 in H/L, L/H, and L/L increased double ovulation rate compared with H/H. Cows with double ovulations had greater pregnancies per AI (P/AI) on d 23 post-AI compared with cows with single ovulations but had greater losses if ovulations were unilateral. Cows with low P4 during the entire period of the ovulatory follicle development also had greater P/AI on d 23 post-AI compared with cows with high P4 during both phases. However, full-term P/AI was not different between treatments. This was a result of the greater incidence of pregnancy losses between d 35 and 56 of gestation for cows with unilateral double ovulations compared with bilateral double ovulations and single ovulatory cows. Cows with single ovulation and low circulating P4 during the dominance period of follicle development had increased pregnancy losses between d 35 and 56 of gestation compared with cows with single ovulations and high P4. The PSPB measurements on d 16 and 23 post-AI were highly accurate in the prediction of pregnancy at d 28. The PSPB differed on d 23 and 28 between cows that had versus cows that did not have pregnancy losses between d 28 and 35 of gestation.

Serum PAG and PSPB concentrations differed among CON cows and PGF and INF cows beginning 1 and 2.5 d after treatment for PAG and PSPB, respectively. By 9.5 d after treatment, PAG and PSPB concentrations were similar to those of nonpregnant cows. We conclude that although timing of conceptus expulsion occurred 5.2 d later for INF than for PGF cows, serum PAG and PSPB concentrations decreased at a similar rate from the onset of treatment for both models of pregnancy loss evaluated.", "year": 2012, "openAccessPdf": {"url": "http://www.journalofdairyscience.org/article/S0022030212000215/pdf", "status": "HYBRID"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "47783514", "name": "J.

Replacement heifers (n = 86) and 613 lactating cows previously inseminated were diagnosed not pregnant to form 77 breeding clusters spanning 36 mo. At not-pregnant diagnosis (d 0), females received 100 mug of GnRH, and then 7 d later, they received 25 mg of PGF(2alpha). Females in 2 treatments received GnRH 48 h (G48) after PGF(2alpha) injection and TAI at the time of the second GnRH injection (G48 + TAI48) or 24 h later (G48 + TAI72). Females in the third treatment received GnRH 72 h after PGF(2alpha) when inseminated (G72 + TAI72). Neither timing of GnRH nor time of AI altered TAI pregnancy rates (average of 20.4%). Ovaries of females in 65 clusters were scanned on d 0 (first GnRH injection) and 7 d later (PGF(2alpha) injection). Ovarian structures were mapped and ovulation in response to the first GnRH injection was evaluated on d 7. When estrus was detected before scheduled TAI, females were inseminated; otherwise, TAI conception of remaining females was based on timing of GnRH and AI in 3 treatments. On d 7, 1 or more new corpora lutea (CL) were detected in 43% of females and their pregnancy rate was subsequently greater (28 vs. 18%) than those not ovulating. Follicle diameters on d 0 did not differ between females that did (11.9 +/- 0.3 mm) and did not (11.8 +/- 0.4 mm) subsequently ovulate in response to GnRH. Follicle diameter and number of follicles >/=5 mm increased with increasing lactation number, but decreased with increasing number of CL. Diameter of follicles in which more than 1 follicle ovulated decreased linearly from that in which only 1 follicle ovulated. Incidence of ovulation increased with increasing lactation number and total number of follicles >/=5 mm, but decreased with increasing number of CL. Incidence of multiple ovulations (15%) was greater in females having more follicles >/=5 mm and in those in early diestrus. Multiple ovulation did not occur in heifers, but was decreased in cows having more than 1 CL. In cows having more than 1 CL, luteal regression was reduced by 5.6 percentage units compared with those having 1 CL.

Similarly, progesterone (P4) and estradiol-17beta (E2) were administered by continuous infusion. Circulating concentrations at steady state were used to calculate the metabolic clearance rate (MCR) of BSP, P4, and E2. Experiment 1: Variation in LBF was determined in thee nonlactating and four lactating cows over 3 d at 3 to 5 h after feeding. Coefficients of variation ranged from 14 to 31% among cows within day and from 4 to 8% within cows across days. Experiment 2: Six nonlactating cows were used in a 3 x 3 Latin-square design with three feed regimens: no feed, 0.5 maintenance diet (M), and 1.5 M. Experiment 3: Eight lactating cows were used in a 4 x 4 Latin-square design with four feed regimens: no feed, 0.5 M, 1.5 M, and 2.2 M. In experiments 2 and 3, LBF and MCR of P4 increased immediately after feed consumption and increases persisted longer at higher intakes. The LBF reached a maximum at 2 h after feeding and MCR of P4 reached maximum at 3 h after feeding with a positive correlation (r = 0.92) between LBF and MCR for P4. Experiment 4: A crossover design was used to determine MCR of E2 in unfed or full-fed lactating dairy cows. The MCR of E2 increased immediately after feeding and stayed elevated throughout the 4.5-h infusion period. Thus, LBF and steroid metabolism were acutely elevated by feed consumption in lactating and nonlactating cows. Higher rates of LBF and steroid metabolism in lactating than in nonlactating cows may indicate chronic effects of higher feed intakes as well.", "year": 2002, "openAccessPdf": {"url": "http://www.journalofdairyscience.org/article/S0022030202743701/pdf", "status": "HYBRID"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "4767754", "name": "S.

Ten nonpregnant, nonlactating Holstein cows were blocked by lactation and assigned randomly to a normocalcemic (NC; intravenous infusion of 0.9% NaCl i.v. plus 43 g of oral Ca, as Ca sulfate and Ca chloride, at -1 and 11h) or an induced SCH [SCHI, 5% ethylene glycol tetraacetic acid (EGTA), a selective iCa(2+) chelator, intravenous infusion] treatment for 24h, using a crossover design. The sequence of treatments was either NC-SCHI or SCHI-NC, with a 6-d washout period. Ionized Ca was evaluated before, hourly during the infusion period, and at 48 and 72 h, to monitor concentrations and adjust the rate of infusion, maintaining blood iCa(2+) <1.0mM in SCHI throughout the 24-h infusion period. Additional measurements included heart and respiratory rates, rectal temperature, dry matter intake, rumen contractions, whole-blood pH, concentrations of glucose and K in whole blood, concentrations of total Ca, Mg, nonesterified fatty acids, \u03b2-hydroxybutyrate, and insulin in plasma, and urinary excretion of Ca. Total and differential leukocyte count in blood was also performed. The concentration of cytosolic iCa(2+) in neutrophils and lymphocytes was quantified and neutrophil function was assayed in vitro. Infusion of a 5% EGTA solution successfully induced SCH in all SCHI cows, resulting in decreased blood iCa(2+) concentrations throughout the 24-h treatment period (0.77 \u00b1 0.01 vs. 1.26 \u00b1 0.01 mM iCa(2+)). Induction of SCH reduced dry matter intake on the day of infusion (5.3 \u00b1 0.8 vs. 9.1 \u00b1 0.8 kg/d) and rumen contractions (1.9 \u00b1 0.2 vs. 2.7 \u00b1 0.2 contractions/2 min) for the last 12h of infusion.

Furthermore, induction of SCH reduced the percentage of neutrophils undergoing phagocytosis (22.1 \u00b1 2.1 vs. 29.3 \u00b1 2.1%) and reduced the oxidative burst response after incubation of pathogenic bacteria (16.1 \u00b1 1.7 vs. 24.2 \u00b1 1.7%).

Blood was sampled within 24h of calving and analyzed for serum total calcium. Fifteen Holstein dairy cows were classified as having subclinical hypocalcemia (serum calcium concentration \u2264 1.8 mmol/L, without clinical milk fever) and were matched with 15 control cows (serum calcium concentration >1.8 mmol/L) based on parity and presence of other diseases. Daily feeding and drinking behavior were monitored using an electronic feeding system (Insentec, BV, Marknesse, the Netherlands) and summarized by week relative to calving (wk -3, -2, -1, +1, +2, and +3). Standing behavior was monitored from 7 d before until 7 d after calving using dataloggers. Daily milk yields were obtained for all cows up to 280 d in milk (DIM). These data were summarized by week for the first 4 wk of lactation to assess short-term differences in milk yield, and were summarized into 4-wk periods to assess long-term (280 DIM) differences in milk yield between groups. Cows with subclinical hypocalcemia produced, on average, 5.7 kg/d more milk during wk 2, 3, and 4 compared with control cows; however, only subclinically hypocalcemic cows in their third lactation sustained greater milk yields throughout 280 DIM. Despite greater milk yield during the weeks following calving, cows with subclinical hypocalcemia did not consume more water after calving and tended to have greater dry matter intake only during wk 2. However, these animals made fewer visits to the water bins during the first 2 wk after calving and tended to make fewer visits to the feed bins during wk 1 and 3, suggesting that they used these resources more efficiently. Dry matter intake was, on average, 1.7 kg/d greater during wk -2 and -1 among cows subsequently diagnosed with subclinical hypocalcemia compared with control cows but neither group was lactating during this period. Cows with subclinical hypocalcemia stood for 2.6h longer during the 24-h period before parturition, which may suggest these animals experience increased discomfort at calving; these cows spent 2.7h less time standing during d +1. Although milk yield was greater among cows with subclinical hypocalcemia, this study controlled for the confounding effects of disease incidence; these results do not refute previous research that associates subclinical hypocalcemia with an increased risk for health disorders. The mechanisms by which subclinical hypocalcemia is associated with behavior and production require further investigation.", "year": 2012, "openAccessPdf": {"url": "http://www.journalofdairyscience.org/article/S0022030212000823/pdf", "status": "HYBRID"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2094295155", "name": "P.

A cross-sectional study was used to determine prevalence and risk factors with cows followed in a prospective study to determine reproductive outcomes. Lactating Holstein cows were sampled between 40 and 60 d in milk using low-volume uterine lavage, and cytology was evaluated to determine SCE status. In total, 779 cows from 38 herds were used in the analysis. The cow-level prevalence of SCE was 25.9%.

A linear single-trait sire-maternal grandsire model and a threshold model using a Gibbs sampling technique were used to analyse calving data from 1985 to 1996. In first calving when using the linear model, the heritability of stillbirth on the visible scale was 4% for the direct effect and 3% for the maternal effect. For calving difficulty it was 6% and 5% for direct and maternal effects, respectively. In second calving the corresponding heritabilities for the two traits were considerably lower, less than 1%. Adjusting for calving difficulty in linear analysis of stillbirth halved the heritabilities for the direct and maternal effects in first calving. When using a threshold model, heritabilities for stillbirth in first-calvers were 12% and 8% for direct and maternal effects, respectively, and for calving difficulty they were 17% and 12%. At second calving corresponding heritabilities were 2 to 4% for stillbirth and 4 to 7% for calving difficulty. The correlation between direct and maternal effects was around -0.1, irrespective of whether the linear or the threshold model was used for first-calvers. The genetic correlations between bulls' EBV from first and second calving were 0.4 to 0.5 for direct and maternal effects in stillbirth, whereas they were 0.6 to 0.7 for calving difficulty. In first-calvers there was a substantial genetic variation in both traits, expressed by differences between breeding values of bulls, despite fairly low heritability.

The incidence of ovarian cysts has been reported to be from 6 to 19% and, therefore, cystic ovarian disease is a serious cause of reproductive failure in dairy cattle. There have been several different hypotheses about the cause of ovarian cysts. After monitoring postpartum cows that spontaneously developed ovarian cysts and postpartum cows with or without ovarian cysts administered estradiol benzoate, the authors have suggested that postpartum ovarian cysts developed when the hypothalamus and pituitary appeared to be less responsive in releasing luteinizing hormone (LH) under the influence of estradiol. Spontaneous reestablishment of ovarian cycles occurred in about 60% of the cows that developed ovarian cysts before the first postpartum ovulation. In contrast, only about 20% of the cows that developed ovarian cysts after the first postpartum ovulation spontaneously reestablished ovarian cycles. The authors have also reported that even if ovarian cycles are not reestablished, ovarian cysts may regress, but only in the presence of follicular development, which subsequently develops into ovarian cysts. Investigators have shown that 40 to 80% of the cows with ovarian cysts reestablished ovarian cycles following treatment with products high in LH activity. Gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH), which stimulates reestablishment of ovarian cysts in about 80% of the cows treated, has more recently been recommended as a treatment for ovarian cysts. The GnRH-induced LH surge appears to stimulate luteinization of the ovarian cyst wall. Cows then exhibit estrus about 21 d following GnRH treatment. The conception rate at the first estrus after GnRH treatment has been reported to be 40 to 50%. The interval from GnRH treatment to estrus has been reduced by administering prostaglandin F2 alpha (PGF2 alpha) 9 d after GnRH. The PGF2 alpha appears to regress the luteinized ovarian cysts and cows exhibit estrus 2 to 3 d after PGF2 alpha treatment (11 to 12 d after GnRH). Gonadotropin releasing hormone has also been used to reduce the incidence of ovarian cysts in postpartum cows. To be effective in reducing the incidence of ovarian cysts, GnRH should be administered about 2 wk postpartum. However, cows may have a predisposition for cystic ovarian disease and treatments, therefore, are only temporary solutions. A better alternative would probably be to select against ovarian cysts.", "year": 1982, "openAccessPdf": null, "authors": [{"authorId": "2084350", "name": "D.

However, it is likely that the vitamin E requirement of the modern dairy cow is very different from that of a calf. This review of the literature investigates the effect of vitamin E supplementation on the health and fertility of the dairy cow. Supplementation of high levels of vitamin E (at least 1000 iu per day) during the dry period and early lactation can reduce the incidence of mastitis, possibly because of an increase in immune system activity and function, but there appears to be little benefit of supplementation on infectious diseases other than mastitis. The evidence for a response in the reproductive system is more equivocal. In herds with a history of selenium deficiency and a high incidence of retained fetal membranes, supplementation, in conjunction with selenium, can reduce retention, but the evidence for an effect of supplementation on other reproductive diseases, such as cystic ovarian disease and metritis, is based on a very limited number of cases. The literature suggests that the current recommendations for vitamin E are inadequate. In particular, it suggests that the current linking of requirement to dry matter intake is incorrect, because vitamin E requirement is probably at its highest when intake is at its lowest. However, the majority of the data on which this conclusion is based, come from North America where cows will encounter significantly different levels of oxidative stress from cows in the EU.", "year": 2000, "openAccessPdf": null, "authors": [{"authorId": "48749888", "name": "R.

Data from 2,178 Holstein cows in 6 herds enrolled in a randomized clinical trial were used. Milk production data from the first 4 Dairy Herd Improvement Association (DHIA) test-days and culling data from farm records were collected. Retained placenta (RP; \u226524 h after parturition) and metritis [\u226420 d in milk (DIM)] were diagnosed by farm managers using standardized definitions. Farms were visited weekly and cows were examined at 35 and 56 (\u00b13) DIM using endometrial cytology (cytobrush device), vaginal discharge scoring (Metricheck device), and measurement of cervical diameter by transrectal palpation. Diagnostic criteria for cytological endometritis (CYTO) and purulent vaginal discharge (PVD) were established based on a detrimental effect on subsequent reproduction. Statistical analyses were performed using linear mixed models, logistic regression models, and Cox proportional hazard models, accounting for the effects of experimental treatments and herd clustering. Milk production and culling were the outcomes. Primiparous and multiparous cows were modeled separately for milk production. Milk production of primiparous cows was unaffected by uterine diseases. The effect of metritis on milk production was variable over time in multiparous cows: it decreased production per cow by 3.7 kg at the first DHIA test, but was not different at later tests. Retained placenta decreased milk production by 2.6 kg/d in multiparous cows through the first 4 DHIA tests. The projected effects of metritis and RP in multiparous cows were reductions of 259 kg and 753 kg over 305 DIM, respectively; these effects were additive. Neither CYTO nor PVD affected milk production. Culling risks at 30 and 63 DIM were unaffected by RP and metritis. Culling hazard up to 300 DIM was unaffected by RP, metritis, CYTO, or PVD, whether or not pregnancy status, milk production, and displaced abomasum were accounted for.

Comparisons of lactation curves were used to identify where the bST response occurred in the lactation cycle. Analysis demonstrated the responses in milk, milk fat, and protein yield were minimal in the early phase of lactation, and then gradually increased until reaching a plateau over the last half of the lactation cycle. Persistency of lactation was also improved by bST, indicating the opportunity exists to extend lactation with combined use of bST and altered reproductive management. Average age and days in milk did not differ between control and bST herds. Thus, stayability and herd-life of animals were not altered by bST treatment.

This does not only imply possible problems with animal welfare, but it also causes economic losses to the farmer. The objective of this study was to evaluate time trends in on-farm dairy cow mortality in Sweden and identify potential herd-level risk factors. Data were retrieved on all Swedish dairy herds enrolled in the milk recording scheme between 2002 and 2010. Herds with a herd size of <20 cows or a mortality rate (MR) of >40 dead or euthanized cows per 100 cow-years were excluded. Two different models were used: 1 multiple-year analysis, which included 6,898 herds during the period 2002 to 2010 and 1 single-year analysis including 4,252 herds for the year 2010, where other variables that were not present during the entire multiple year study were analyzed. The outcome variable was the number of euthanized and dead cows per year and season. A negative binomial regression model, adjusted for clustering within herd, was applied to both models. Fixed effects in the multiple-year analysis were breed, calving interval, herd size, milk yield, region, season, pasture period, and year. The fixed effects in the single-year analysis were breed, calving interval, conventional versus organic farming, herd size, housing system, milk yield, region, and season. The results demonstrated that MR gradually increased from 5.1 to 6.6 events per 100 cow-years during the study period. Swedish MR are consequently on par with, or even greater than, MR among dairy herds in other comparable countries. Higher mortality was associated with larger herd size, longer calving intervals, and herds that had Swedish Holstein as the predominant breed. Lower mortality was observed in herds with a higher herd average milk yield, during the fall and winter, and in organically managed herds. There were regional differences in mortality. An interaction between herd size and season was found in both models. Also, an interaction between housing system and milk yield was found in the single-year analysis. This first assessment of on-farm mortality in Swedish dairy herds confirmed that the MR has increased over the last few years. The study also identified some herd-level risk factors.\n \n", "year": 2012, "openAccessPdf": {"url": "http://www.journalofdairyscience.org/article/S0022030212004237/pdf", "status": "HYBRID"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "13407035", "name": "K.

The first objective of this study was to estimate the effect of a difficult calving on the subsequent first-lactation milk production by estimating lactation curves using cubic splines. This methodology allows the estimation of daily milk, protein, and fat yields following calvings of differing degrees of difficulty. Losses in milk yield after a difficult calving have been quantified previously; however, estimates are generally restricted to the accumulated yields at specific days in lactation. By fitting cubic splines, gaps (in which the shape of the lactation curve can be merely guessed) between estimations were avoided. The second objective of this study was to estimate the effect of a difficult birth on the subsequent performance of the calf as an adult animal. Even though the calving process is known to involve cooperation between dam and calf, the effect of a difficult calving has, until now, only been estimated for the subsequent performance of the dam. Addressing the effects of a difficult birth on the adult calf strengthens the importance of calving ease as a selection trait because it suggests that the benefit of genetic improvement may currently be underestimated. The effect of calving ease on the subsequent reproductive performance of dam and calf was analyzed using linear regression and with calving ease score fitted as a fixed effect. Dams with veterinary-assisted calvings required 0.7 more services to conception and 8 more days to first service and experienced a 28-d longer calving interval in first lactation compared with dams that were not assisted at calving. Effects of calving ease on the reproductive performance of the adult calf in first lactation were not detected. Losses in milk yield of the dam were significant between d 9 to 90 in milk subsequent to a veterinary-assisted calving, creating a loss of approximately 2 kg of milk per day, compared with a nonassisted calving. Calves being born with difficulties showed a significant reduction in milk yield in first lactation, demonstrating the lifelong effect of a difficult birth. Compared with nonassisted calves, veterinary-assisted calves showed a loss of 710 kg in accumulated 305-d milk yield, which was significant from 129 to 261 d in milk. This suggests that from birth to production, physiological effects of a bad calving are not negated. Results furthermore suggest a beneficial effect of farmer assistance at calving on the milk yield of both dam and calf, when moderate difficulties occurred.", "year": 2011, "openAccessPdf": {"url": "http://www.journalofdairyscience.org/article/S0022030211005686/pdf", "status": "HYBRID"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "7013202", "name": "S.

To describe the herd-level and contextual factors affecting cow mortality, the French National Bovine Dataset Identification was used to create dairy, beef, or fattening units within farms, for 2005 and 2006. Mortality rate (MO-RA, outcome variable) and most variables were calculated at the unit level, whereas contextual variables were defined at the municipality level [cattle density, inhabitant density, agricultural land always with grass on overall agricultural land (ALWG/OAL)]. The localization (11 dairy production areas, representative of the farming systems) was also included. The statistical analysis was performed with a probit regression model (MO-RA=0 or>0) and with a linear model corrected by the Heckman method for bias sample selection. For 2005 and 2006, 3.8 and 3.7 million dairy cow-years, 101,445 and 96,954 dairy units, and 141,677 and 143,424 deaths were recorded, respectively.

Negative associations were reported for breed other than Holstein, being a Good Breeding Practices member, having a calving peak in autumn, culling rate, and municipal cattle density.

After edits, 3,629,002 lactation records were available for cows calving between 2001 and 2006 in 2,054 herds located in 38 states primarily east of the Mississippi river. The distribution of culled cows by disposal code was estimated by parity, days after calving, pregnancy status, cow-relative 305-d mature equivalent milk yield, herd-relative 305-d mature equivalent milk yield, and season. Of all herds, 57% reported all 8 different disposal codes excluding the codes dairy purposes and reason not reported.

The primary disposal code was died (20.6% of all culling), followed by reproduction (17.7%), injury/other (14.3%), and low production and mastitis (both 12.1%). The risk of culling with various disposal codes varied with stage of lactation. Died and reproduction were the most frequently reported codes for cows leaving the herd during early and late lactation, respectively. Early lactation was also a critical period for culling with the disposal codes injury/other and disease, and the risk increased with days after calving for the codes low production and reproduction. The risk of culling with the disposal code died showed the greatest seasonal pattern with increased risk of death in spring and summer. A negative association was found between annualized live culling and death rates within herds. Compared with open cows, pregnant cows had a lower risk of culling with all reported disposal codes.

The final multivariable model included 7 representative variables: herd levels of respiratory disease, lameness, and antibiotic use for treating sick cows, the percentage of culled cows less than 50 d in milk, the average calving interval, the use of a total mixed ration, and the region of the country. Increased odds of a greater level of mortality on farms was associated with greater percentages of lameness, respiratory disease, and sick cows treated with antibiotics, demonstrating the influence of physical derangements and disease on dairy cow mortality. Increased odds of a greater level of mortality was also associated with feeding a total mixed ration, culling fewer cows in early lactation, and herds located in western, midwestern, and southeastern regions relative to the northeastern United States, pointing to the importance of management decisions and operation characteristics on mortality outcomes. Further, an important interplay between facets of health and management on dairy cow mortality was suggested through the inclusion of the calving interval, with a longer calving interval leading to increased odds of a greater level of mortality on farms.

Milk, fat, and protein yields were adjusted to 305 d. Days open was truncated to 305 d, and the number of services was truncated to 9. Survival of a cow during a full lactation (305 d) was recorded as 0 (died) or 1 (alive). Variance components for the six traits were estimated using a multiple-trait animal model and the REML procedure. The model included herd-year-season, parity (three groups), age (three groups nested within parity), sex of calf (1 = male, 2 = female), and dystocia score (1 = no problem,..., 5 = extreme difficulty) as fixed effects and animal and permanent environment as random effects. Heritabilities for milk, fat, and protein yields, days open, number of services and cow survival were 0.2, 0.18, 0.18, 0.04, 0.03, and 0.002, respectively. The corresponding repeatabilities were 0.42, 0.41, 0.41, 0.12, 0.08, and 0.009, respectively. Genetic and phenotypic correlations between yield traits were high and positive, and correlations between yields and reproduction traits were high and antagonistic. Phenotypic correlations between survival and yields were about 0.1, and their genetic counterparts were slightly negative. Thus, management practices seem to keep mortality rates of high producing cows lower even though those cows have lower genetic potential for survival than do the low producers. Fertility traits showed a slightly undesirable (e.g., 0.1 to 0.3) genetic relationship with survival, but phenotypic correlations were essentially 0. For heifers, yields increased significantly with age. For cows in other parities, the significant changes with age were reduced fertility and reduced survival.", "year": 1998, "openAccessPdf": null, "authors": [{"authorId": "3511517", "name": "C.

Ovarian follicular development was monitored daily via ultrasound in lactating Holstein cows. Animals underwent bilateral ovariectomy when the dominant follicle was first identified (days 4-6; estrus = day 0; early; n = 5) or when it stopped growing (days 8-12; late; n = 8). All follicles were classified as dominant (DF), large (LG; > = 6 mm in diameter, excluding DF) or small (SM; < 6 mm), follicular fluid was aspirated, and theca and granulosa cells were collected. Levels of IGFBP-2, assessed via ligand blotting, were greater (P < 0.05) in LG and SM follicles compared with DF in early cows. Levels of IGFBP-3 in follicular fluid were unaffected by follicle class. Numbers of specific 125I-hCG/LH binding sites in thecal cells were greater (P < 0.01) in DF compared with LG and SM follicles of both early and late cows. Numbers of specific 125I-hCG/LH binding sites in granulosa cells were similar for follicle sizes in early cows, but, in late cows, were greater (P < 0.01) in DF compared with SM follicles and were severalfold greater (P < 0.01) in late DF compared with early DF. Numbers of receptors for IGF-I in thecal cells were 2-fold greater (P < 0.05) in DP and LG compared with SM in late cows. Numbers of IGF-I receptors in granulosa cells were unaffected by size or growth of follicles, but were severalfold greater than in theca cells. Concentrations of estradiol were severalfold greater (P < 0.01) in DF compared with LG and SM in both early and late cows. Concentrations of androstenedione in early cows were greater (P < 0.05) in DF and SM compared with LG follicles. Concentrations of progesterone and IGF-I did not differ (P > 0.10) among follicle classes, but both were greater (P < 0.10) in late LG compared with early LG follicles.

In Expt 2, heifers (n = 26) were ovariectomized as in Expt 1, and ovaries were prepared for histomorphometric evaluation.

Data included information from >11 million parturitions from 1999 through 2006 for 7 US dairy breeds. Effects examined were year, herd-year, month, and age within parity of conception; parturition code (sex and multiple-birth status); lactation length and standardized milk yield of cow; service sire; cow sire; and cow. All effects were fixed except for service sire, cow sire, and cow. Mean GL for heifers and cows, respectively, were 277.8 and 279.4 d for Holsteins, 278.4 and 280.0 d for Jerseys, 279.3 and 281.1 d for Milking Shorthorns, 281.6 and 281.7 d for Ayrshires, 284.8 and 285.7 d for Guernseys, and 287.2 and 287.5 d for Brown Swiss. Estimated standard deviations of GL were greatly affected by data restrictions but generally were approximately 5 to 6 d. Year effects on GL were extremely small, but month effects were moderate. For Holstein cows, GL was 2.0 d shorter for October conceptions than for January and February conceptions; 4.7 and 5.6 d shorter for multiple births of the same sex than for single-birth females and males, respectively; 0.8 d longer for lactations of < or =250 d than for lactations of > or =501 d; and 0.6 d shorter for standardized yield of < or =8,000 kg than for yield of > or =14,001 kg. Estimates for GL heritability from parities 2 to 5 were 33 to 36% for service sire and 7 to 12% for cow sire; corresponding estimates from parity 1 were 46 to 47% and 10 to 12%. Estimates of genetic correlations between effects of service sire and cow sire on GL were 0.70 to 0.85 for Brown Swiss, Holsteins, and Jerseys, which indicates that those traits likely are controlled by many of the same genes and can be used to evaluate each other. More accurate prediction of calving dates can help dairy producers to meet management requirements of pregnant animals and to administer better health care during high-risk phases of animals' lives. However, intentional selection for either shorter or longer GL is not recommended without consideration of its possible effect on other dependent traits (e.g., calving ease and stillbirth).", "year": 2009, "openAccessPdf": {"url": "http://www.journalofdairyscience.org/article/S0022030209705429/pdf", "status": "HYBRID"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "143909665", "name": "H.

Our main hypothesis was that DO would increase fertility in primiparous cows, but not in multiparous cows. Within each herd (n=3), lactating dairy cows (n=1,687; 778 primiparous, 909 multiparous) were randomly assigned to DO [n=837; GnRH-7d-PGF(2\u03b1)-3d-GnRH-7d-Ovsynch-56 (GnRH-7d-PGF(2\u03b1)-56h-GnRH-16hTAI)] or PS (n=850; PGF(2\u03b1)-14d-PGF(2\u03b1)-12d-Ovsynch-56). In 1 herd, concentrations of P4 were determined at the first GnRH (GnRH1) of Ovsynch-56 and at d 11 after TAI (n=739). In all herds, pregnancy was diagnosed by palpation per rectum at 39 d. In 1 herd, the incidence of late embryo loss was determined at 74d, and data were available on P/AI at the subsequent second service. Presynchronization with DO reduced the percentage of animals with low P4 concentrations (<0.50 ng/mL) at GnRH1 of Ovsynch-56 (5.4 vs. 25.3%, DO vs. PS). A lesser percentage of both primiparous and multiparous cows treated with DO had low P4 concentrations at GnRH1 of Ovsynch-56 (3.3 vs. 19.7%, DO vs. PS primiparous; and 8.8 vs. 31.9%, DO vs. PS multiparous). Presynchronization with DO improved P/AI at the first postpartum service (46.3 vs. 38.2%, DO vs. PS). Statistically, a fertility improvement could be detected for primiparous cows treated with DO (52.5 vs. 42.3%, DO vs. PS, primiparous), but only a tendency could be detected in multiparous cows (40.3 vs. 34.3%, DO vs. PS, multiparous), consistent with our original hypothesis. Presynchronization treatment had no effect on the incidence of late embryo loss after first service (8.5 vs. 5.5%, DO vs. PS). A lower body condition score increased the percentage of cows with low P4 at GnRH1 of Ovsynch-56 and reduced fertility to the TAI. In addition, P4 concentration at d 11 after TAI was reduced by DO. The method of presynchronization at first service had no effect on P/AI at the subsequent second service (34.7 vs. 36.5%, DO vs. PS). Thus, presynchronization with DO induced cyclicity in most anovular cows and improved fertility compared with PS, suggesting that DO could be a useful reproductive management protocol for synchronizing first service in commercial dairy herds.", "year": 2012, "openAccessPdf": {"url": "http://www.journalofdairyscience.org/article/S0022030212007047/pdf", "status": "HYBRID"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2760982", "name": "M.

Data were from nearly 20 million breedings during >8 million lactations of >5 million cows in >23,000 herds. Means were also calculated for some traits by parity and breeding number for both breeds and by geographical region and synchronization status for Holsteins. The DFB declined for Holsteins from 92 d in 1996 to 85 d in 2007; the trend in yearly differences was not as consistent for Jerseys. First- and all-breeding 70-d nonreturn rate declined 5 to 9 percentage units over time. First- and all-breeding CR declined 2 to 4 percentage units. The DFB were longer for later parities of Holsteins than for early parities. Second- and third-breeding CR were sometimes 1 to 2 percentage units above first-breeding CR for Holsteins but lower (1 to 7 percentage units) for Jerseys.

Mean PR was highest for the Southwest (28.3%) and lowest for the Mideast and Southeast (22.2%). Use of timed artificial insemination following synchronized estrus appears to have reduced DFB, lowered CR, and increased NB while reducing DLB and CI.

Lactating Holstein cows (n=154) were assigned randomly to 1 of 2 treatments. Cows underwent a presynchronization of the estrous cycle composed of an injection of GnRH concurrently with the placement of a progesterone insert, an injection of PGF(2\u03b1) and insert removal 7 d later, and a second injection of GnRH 48 h later (study d -16). All cows were then submitted to a hormonal protocol identical to the presynchronization program starting on d 7 of the estrous cycle (study d -9). Cows enrolled in the high progesterone (HP) treatment received no further treatment. Cows in the low progesterone (LP) treatment received additional PGF(2\u03b1) injections on study d -14, -13.5, and -13 and again on study d -9, -7, -6.5, and -6. Ovaries were evaluated by ultrasonography, and blood was sampled for concentrations of progesterone and estradiol throughout the study. Uteri were flushed 6 d after artificial insemination (AI) and recovered oocytes-embryos were evaluated. Concentrations of progesterone were less for LP cows from study d -7 to -2; concentrations of estradiol at PGF(2\u03b1) and at the last GnRH of synchronization were greater for LP than HP. The proportion of cows in estrus at AI was greater for LP than for HP (38.0 vs. 5.3%). Ovulatory follicles of LP cows had larger diameters at the injections of PGF(2\u03b1) (17.2 vs. 14.6mm) and final GnRH (19.4 vs. 16.9%) of the synchronization, which resulted in a larger diameter of the corpus luteum 6 d after AI (24.3 vs. 22.6mm). Double ovulation after the last GnRH of the synchronization was increased in LP (18.6%) compared with HP (4.5%). Fertilization rate was similar and averaged 82.7%. The proportion of embryos and oocytes-embryos classified as grades 1 and 2, proportion of degenerated embryos, and unfertilized-degenerated oocytes-embryos were not different between LP and HP. Number of blastomeres did not differ between LP and HP, but the proportion of live blastomeres tended to be less for LP than HP (94.2 vs. 98.7%).

The scale used to measure BCS differs between countries, but low values always reflect emaciation and high values equate to obesity. The intercalving profile of BCS is a mirror image of the milk lactation profile. Cows lose condition for 50 to 100 d postcalving, because of homeorhetic changes that occur in the somatotropic axis and the sensitivity of peripheral tissues to insulin, and the upregulation of lipolytic pathways in adipose tissue. Management and feeding have little effect on early postcalving BCS loss (wk 1 to 4 postcalving) until the natural period of insulin resistance has passed and the somatotropic axis has recoupled. There is evidence, however, that management and diet can influence the timing of recoupling of the somatotropic axis and the sensitivity of peripheral tissues to insulin, and gene expression differences in adipose tissue 30 d in milk confirm an effect of energy intake on lipogenic enzymes. The BCS in which a cow calves, nadir BCS, and the amount of BCS she loses postcalving are associated with milk production, reproduction, and health. Body condition score may also be a valid indicator of animal welfare, but further research is required to determine the effect of BCS and BCS change on how a cow \"feels.\" Although the actual strength of the association may vary, there is relative consistency in the associations among calving and nadir BCS, and BCS change on milk production, postpartum anestrous, the likelihood of a successful pregnancy and days open, the risk of uterine infection, and the risk of metabolic disorders. For many production and health variables, the association with BCS is nonlinear, with an optimum calving BCS of 3.0 to 3.25 (5-point scale); lower calving BCS is associated with reduced production and reproduction, whereas calving BCS >/=3.5 (5-point scale) is associated with a reduction in early lactation dry matter intake and milk production and an increased risk of metabolic disorders. Ongoing research into the automation of body condition scoring suggests that it is a likely candidate to be incorporated into decision support systems in the near future to aid producers in making operational and tactical decisions.", "year": 2009, "openAccessPdf": {"url": "http://www.journalofdairyscience.org/article/S0022030209712998/pdf", "status": "HYBRID"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "83858323", "name": "J.

Cows from 4 freestall dairy herds (2 in New York and 2 in Wisconsin) were each tested 6 times for SCK from 3 to 16 DIM using the Precision Xtra meter (Abbott Laboratories, Abbott Park, IL). Subclinical ketosis was defined as a BHBA concentration of 1.2 to 2.9 mmol/L. Mixed-effects multivariable Poisson regression was used to assess DA, removal from herd, and conception to first service. Semiparametric proportional hazards models were used to evaluate days to conception, and repeated-measures ANOVA was used to evaluate milk yield in the first 30 DIM. A total of 741 of 1,717 (43.2%) eligible cows had a least one BHBA test of 1.2 to 2.9 mmol/L. Peak incidence of SCK occurred at 5 DIM, when 22.3% of cows had their first SCK-positive test. Peak prevalence of SCK occurred at 5 DIM, when 28.9% of cows had a SCK-positive test. Median time from first positive SCK test until BHBA test <1.2 mmol/L was 5d.

For the production outcomes, models for first test day milk yield, milk fat, and milk protein percentage were constructed including covariates of parity, precalving body condition score, season of calving, test day linear score, and the random effect of herd. Each cutpoint was tested in these models to determine the threshold with the greatest impact and least risk of a type 1 error. Serum BHBA concentrations at or above 1,200 micromol/L in the first week following calving were associated with increased risks of subsequent displaced abomasum [odds ratio (OR) = 2.60] and metritis (OR = 3.35), whereas the critical threshold of BHBA in wk 2 postpartum on the risk of abomasal displacement was >or=1,800 micromol/L (OR = 6.22). The best threshold for predicting subsequent risk of clinical ketosis from serum obtained during wk 1 and wk 2 postpartum was 1,400 micromol/L of BHBA (OR = 4.25 and 5.98, respectively). There was no association between clinical mastitis and elevated serum BHBA in wk 1 or 2 postpartum, and there was no association between wk 2 BHBA and risk of metritis. Greater serum BHBA measured during the first and second week postcalving were associated with less milk yield, greater milk fat percentage, and less milk protein percentage on the first Dairy Herd Improvement test day of lactation. Impacts on first Dairy Herd Improvement test milk yield began at BHBA >or=1,200 micromol/L for wk 1 samples and >or=1,400 micromol/L for wk 2 samples. The greatest impact on yield occurred at 1,400 micromol/L (-1.88 kg/d) and 2,000 micromol/L (-3.3 kg/d) for sera from the first and second week postcalving, respectively. Hyperketonemia can be defined at 1,400 micromol/L of BHBA and in the first 2 wk postpartum increases disease risk and results in substantial loss of milk yield in early lactation.", "year": 2009, "openAccessPdf": {"url": "http://www.journalofdairyscience.org/article/S0022030209703613/pdf", "status": "HYBRID"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "4806386", "name": "T.

Sixteen assessors visited the farms monthly and the same assessor assigned a BCS to each cow once a month. A BCS of 3.5 or higher at calving was associated with increased risk for ketosis. Cows that subsequently developed ketosis had higher BCS than healthy cows before the disease was diagnosed, and they lost more body condition than did the latter after ketosis had occurred. Summer calving cows and primiparous cows showed the lowest risk of ketosis. A history of ketosis before first service decreased the likelihood of conception to that service. Loss in body condition during the postpartum period was associated with decreased likelihood of conception to first service, prolonged calving to conception intervals and increased number of artificial inseminations per conception.

A technician visited 1044 cows in 20 herds weekly from 1 wk before expected calving until 1 wk postpartum. Cows were assigned a body condition score and samples were collected at each visit for measurement of serum nonesterified fatty acids (NEFA), cholesterol, beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHBA), glucose, urea, calcium, and phosphorus, and a milk sample was collected postpartum for measurement of BHBA. The probability of LDA was modeled with multivariable logistic regression accounting for clustering. There were 53 cases of LDA (incidence risk = 5.1%) and the median time of diagnosis was 11 d in milk. In cows with LDA, mean NEFA concentrations began to diverge from the mean in cows without LDA 14 d before calving, whereas mean serum BHBA concentrations did not diverge until the day of calving. Prepartum, only NEFA concentration was associated with risk of subsequent LDA. Between 0 and 6 d before calving, cows with NEFA concentration > or =0.5 mEq/L were 3.6 times more likely to develop LDA after calving. For prospective application, among samples taken 4 to 10 d before expected calving, the optimum NEFA cut-point remained 0.5 mEq/L. The sensitivity, specificity, and likelihood ratio (LR) were 46%, 82%, and 2.6, respectively. Between 1 and 7 d postpartum, retained placenta, metritis, and increasing serum concentrations of BHBA and NEFA were associated with increased risk of subsequent LDA. However, considered separately, postpartum serum BHBA was a more sensitive and specific test than NEFA concentration. The odds of LDA were 8 times greater in cows with serum BHBA > or =1200 micromol/L (LR = 3.5). Cows with milk BHBA concentration > or =200 micromol/L were 3.4 times more likely to develop LDA.

One-half of the 1552 herds in the final edited records had measures for at least 8 yr. Measures of reproductive performance changed significantly over time. Days to first service increased from a low of 84 d in 1983 to 104 d in 2001. Cows that calved during spring had 9.2 (1983) to 33.2 (1999) more days to first service than cows that calved during fall. Annual pregnancy rates (PR) for 71 to 364 d since last calving (DSC; PR(71-364)) decreased from 21.6% in 1977 to 1979, to 12% in 2000 to 2002. The greatest PR(71-364) was observed during winter and the lowest during summer (15.8 vs. 5.6% in 2002, respectively). The absolute difference between PR(71-364) during winter and summer remained similar over time at 11 percentage units. Pregnancy rates in the early stages since calving (71 to 133 d) showed greater decreases over time than PR in the later stages since calving. From 1998 to 2002, PR in the later stages since calving (134 to 364 d) was on average 11.5%. Pregnancy rate from 71 to 133 DSC remained greater (13.4%). In the winter, the decrease in PR(71-364) was primarily due to a large decrease in PR(71-91). Average days to conception increased from a low of 121 in 1982 to a high of 167 in 1998. The average difference between cows that calved during spring and fall increased from 22 d in 1976 to 47.5 d in 1986, but remained constant at 39.1 d from 1985.

The last milk yield recorded less than 1 mo before culling of nonpregnant cows after 182 DSC decreased by DSC to approximately 1 yr since calving, after which it remained constant at an average of 12.3 kg/d. The last known milk yield of cows culled during spring was 1.6 kg/d greater than those culled during fall. This difference did not significantly change over time.

For 35% of all cows that were culled, a secondary reason for culling was assigned by the farmer, and, for 11% of all cows that were culled, a tertiary reason was recorded. Using a weighting factor of 5:3:1 (primary:secondary:tertiary reasons for culling), a culling score was computed for each reason within a herd. Reproduction was the primary reason for culling, production was second, and mastitis was third. Much variation existed as to why dairy farmers culled cows. Computed mean culling scores suggested that culling for mastitis was lower in high producing Holstein herds, and culling for abortion was higher in high producing Holstein herds. Culling for reproduction was higher in high producing Holstein herds, and culling for production was lower in high producing Holstein herds. Culling for mastitis and production were significantly lower in high producing Holstein herds than in non-Holstein herds.

During the periparturient period the demands for calcium are increased; these increased demands for calcium can result in subclinical or clinical hypocalcemia. Periparturient cows also experience significant immune suppression. Because intracellular calcium signaling is a key early feature in immune cell activation, we have hypothesized that the increased demand for calcium in periparturient cows may adversely affect intracellular calcium stores of immune cells. This reduction in intracellular calcium stores in immune cells could blunt intracellular calcium release following an activating stimulus, contributing to the immune suppression seen in these animals. To test this hypothesis, peripheral mononuclear cells were obtained from 27 multiparous dairy cows spanning a period of 2 wk before and 2 wk after parturition. Following activation of these cells by anti-CD3 antibodies plus secondary antibodies, intracellular calcium release from intracellular stores was measured. The intracellular calcium released in response to the activation signal declined as calcium demand for lactation became more intense and recovered as plasma calcium normalized. Intracellular calcium stores in peripheral mononuclear cells, estimated by pretreating cells with pervanadate and ionomycin, significantly decreased at parturition and returned to normal levels as the cows' blood calcium returned to normal levels. Hypocalcemia, which is common in periparturient dairy cows, is associated with decreased intracellular calcium stores in peripheral mononuclear cells. Our data suggest that this is the cause of a blunted intracellular calcium release response to an immune cell activation signal. It is concluded that intracellular Ca stores decrease in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) before parturition and development of hypocalcemia. This suggests that systemic calcium stress precedes measurable hypocalcemia, particularly in cows that will develop milk fever. Therefore, PBMC intracellular Ca stores are a more sensitive measure of calcium stresses in transition cow. This decrease in PBMC intracellular Ca stores before parturition and the development of hypocalcemia contributes to periparturient immune suppression.", "year": 2006, "openAccessPdf": {"url": "http://www.journalofdairyscience.org/article/S0022030206723359/pdf", "status": "HYBRID"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "40222051", "name": "K.

Granulosa cells were collected from small (1\u20135 mm) and large (8\u201322 mm) bovine follicles and were treated with IGF2 for 1\u20132 days in serum-free medium, and steroid production, cell proliferation, specific 125I-IGF2 binding, and gene expression were quantified. IGF2 increased both estradiol and progesterone production by granulosa cells, and cells from large follicles were more responsive to the effects of IGF2 than those from small follicles. Abundance of aromatase (CYP19A1) mRNA was stimulated by IGF2 and IGF1. The effective dose (ED50) of IGF2 stimulating 50% of the maximal estradiol production was 63 ng/ml for small follicles and 12 ng/ml for large follicles, and these values were not affected by FSH. The ED50 of IGF2 for progesterone production was 20 ng/ml for both small and large follicles. IGF2 also increased proliferation of granulosa cells by 2- to 3-fold, as determined by increased cell numbers and 3H-thymidine incorporation into DNA. Treatment with IGF1R antibodies reduced the stimulatory effect of IGF2 and IGF1 on estradiol production and cell proliferation. Specific receptors for 125I-IGF2 existed in granulosa cells, and 2-day treatment with estradiol, FSH, or cortisol had no significant effect on specific 125I-IGF2 binding. Also, FSH treatment of small- and large-follicle granulosa cells had no effect on IGF2R mRNA levels, whereas IGF1 decreased IGF2R mRNA and specific 125I-IGF2 binding. Granulosa cell IGF2R mRNA abundance was 3-fold greater in small than in large follicles. These findings support the hypothesis that both IGF2 and its receptor may play a role in granulosa cell function during follicular development. In particular, increased free IGF1 in developing follicles may decrease synthesis of IGF2R, thereby allowing for more IGF2 to be bioavailable (free) for induction of steroidogenesis and mitogenesis via the IGF1R.", "year": 2007, "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://academic.oup.com/biolreprod/article-pdf/77/1/18/10567143/biolreprod0018.pdf", "status": "BRONZE"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "3510788", "name": "L.

The limit of detection was 0.2 ng/ml. The assay was specific for bPAG in that pituitary and placental gonadotropic hormones and other placental or serum proteins assayed in serial dilutions did not cross-react. The RIA allowed measurement of bPAG in placental extracts, fetal serum, fetal fluids, and serum or plasma of pregnant cows. About 20% of unbred heifers and nonpregnant cows had detectable levels ranging from 0.30 +/- 0.09 to 0.50 +/- 0.17 ng/ml (mean +/- SD), and 15% of bull sera showed higher concentrations (3.01 +/- 1.73 ng/ml) of bPAG or bPAG-like protein. Variations among animals was observed in fetal serum bPAG concentrations. Bovine PAG was detected in maternal peripheral blood at Day 22 of pregnancy (mean +/- SD, 0.38 +/- 0.13 ng/ml) in some animals and at Day 30 in all pregnant cows. Peripheral serum bPAG levels increased progressively to 3.60 +/- 1.73 ng/ml (mean +/- SD) at Day 30 of pregnancy, to 24.53 +/- 8.81 ng/ml at Day 120, and to 1551.91 +/- 589.68 ng/ml at Day 270. Peak concentration of bPAG was 2462.42 +/- 1017.88 ng/ml and it occurred 1-5 days prior to parturition.

A herd of 430 Holstein-Friesian heifers that had received transferred embryos were bled at Day 35 postestrus (pe) for measurement of bPAG. The bPAG was detected in 287 of 430 serum samples analyzed. By rectal palpation performed at Day 45 pe, 267 heifers with detectable levels of bPAG at Day 35 pe were confirmed to be pregnant as were 3 of 143 heifers previously diagnosed as not pregnant by RIA.

Overall, feeding the greater volume of colostrum and then treating animals identically in terms of herd management translated into an advantage of 550\u00a0kg of actual milk produced per cow over the first two lactations.Herd managers should encourage the feeding of 4\u00a0L of colostrum to newborn calves because, in addition to health advantages that are well documented in past studies, there would be direct economic return to the producer of approximately $160 per cow in additional milk produced over two lactations.", "year": 2005, "openAccessPdf": null, "authors": [{"authorId": "91497799", "name": "S.

A second analysis was performed replacing the CE effect with the interaction between parity and CE to evaluate the effect of CE in primiparous and multiparous cows. An increase in calving difficulty had a greater impact on culling during first lactations than in subsequent ones. Therefore, difficult calvings, mainly at first parities, had a high impact on herd amortization costs, increasing them by 10% in relation to easy calvings.

Effects of the stage of gestation, stage of lactation, lactation number, milk yield, milk price, replacement heifer cost, probability of pregnancy, probability of involuntary culling, and breeding decisions were studied. A bioeconomic model was used, and breeding and replacement decisions were optimized. A general Holstein herd in the United States was modeled. The average value of a new pregnancy was $278. The value of a new pregnancy increased with days in milk early in lactation but typically decreased later in lactation. Relatively high-producing cows and first-lactation cows reached greater values, and their values peaked later in lactation. The average cost of a pregnancy loss (abortion) was $555. The cost of a pregnancy loss typically increased with gestation length. Sensitivity analyses showed that an increased probability of pregnancy, an increased persistency of milk yield, and a smaller replacement heifer cost greatly reduced the average value of a pregnancy. The value of a new pregnancy was negative for relatively high-producing first-lactation cows when persistency of lactation and the probability of pregnancy were increased. Breeding was delayed when the value of pregnancy was negative. Changes in milk price, absolute milk yield, and probability of involuntary culling had less effect on the value of pregnancy.

Variables related to facilities, labor, and management were obtained via survey, and the relative risk of culling for high-and low-producing cows after expansion (1996 to 2000) was calculated for different levels of each variable. Herds with fewer cows per employee and a greater percentage of labor supplied by family members tended to have lower risk of involuntary culling of profitable cows. Likewise, high-producing cows in herds with fans, sprinklers, self-locking manger stalls, palpation rails, and maternity pens had a significantly lower risk of culling than cows in herds without such facilities. Herds that used 100% artificial insemination (AI) had lower risk of involuntary culling than non-AI herds or herds with a cleanup bull, but 3x milking and use of a custom heifer grower led to unfavorable trends in involuntary culling.

Holsteins were required to have a recorded sire with a National Association of American Breeders code to assure they were sired by artificially inseminated bulls. Normande-, Montbeliarde-, and Scandinavian Red-sired crossbreds were all daughters of artificially inseminated bulls via imported semen. For days open, first-calf heifers were required to be at least 250 d in milk and those with greater than 250 d open were truncated to 250 d.

Heifers (n = 1905) were moved to the breeding group between 360 and 390 d of age and grouped retrospectively according to age at first calving (AFC) as low (< or =700 d), medium (701 to 750 d), and high (> or =751 d). Within farm, growing heifers were managed similarly, as were lactating primiparous cows, for the first 310 d in lactation. Heifers were fed to gain 0.70 to 0.80 kg/d from 4 mo of age to breeding, and 0.8 to 0.9 kg/d from breeding to 252 to 258 d of pregnancy. First calving at <700 d was associated with reduced yields of milk and milk components. Cows in the high age group produced more milk fat and true protein than medium and low cows. Incidence of stillbirths was highest for cows in the low group (19.8%), but stillbirths were also a concern for those calving at medium (16.1%) or high age groups (13.5%). Both low and high cows had lower conception rates at first postpartum AI, and abortions averaged 9.8% across groups. Days open and number of inseminations were lower for medium than low cows. Incidence of mastitis and lameness was lowest for cows in the medium group. Culling and mortality rates were not affected by AFC, but among those that died, cows in the low group tended to die earlier postpartum than cows in the high group. Heifers in the medium group had an adjusted income value numerically higher by 138.33 dollars and 98.81 dollars compared with those in the low and high groups, respectively. First calving at <700 d compromised first lactation yields of milk and milk components and impaired reproductive performance. However, extending AFC beyond 750 d did not improve lactation, reproduction, or health of primiparous cows.

This is because the timing and fates of animals that exit dairy farms have important animal welfare and economic consequences that reflect the conditions under which they are farmed and the efficiency of their production systems. Reports from a few countries have indicated increased incidence of mortality, and occasionally culling, of dairy animals in recent decades, and these changes have been associated with intensification of production systems. Dairy industries and farmers need benchmarks for culling and mortality against which they can compare themselves, as well as improved understanding of the extent of any change and of any associated factors. We reasoned that a systematic literature review and meta-analysis of scientific articles published between 1989 and 2014 would allow us to determine whether these reports were universal, to quantify any change over time, and to investigate whether production systems or study factors were associated with culling and mortality. From 3,275 articles retrieved from databases and manual searching of cited articles, 118 articles were appraised independently by 2 assessors, and 51 articles representing 54 studies were determined to be eligible for review and meta-analysis. We estimated that both the annual incidence risk (IR) and incidence density of mortality of cows had increased significantly from 0.02 per cow and 2.32 per 100 cow-years, to 0.04 per cow and 3.75 per 100 cow-years, an increase per decade of 0.02 per cow and 1.42 per 100 cow-years, respectively. We also estimated that the annual IR of culling attributed to low production had declined significantly from 0.07 to 0.05 and that the IR of perinatal, but not neonatal, mortality had increased significantly from 0.04 to 0.06 per decade. We found no evidence of change in overall annual IR of culling of cows over time or any association between study design factors and the IR or incidence density of culling or mortality. These findings provide benchmarks for describing culling and mortality, and should encourage farmers and researchers in countries with modern dairy industries to discover and implement management strategies to reduce the animal welfare and economic costs associated with these changes.", "year": 2017, "openAccessPdf": {"url": "http://www.journalofdairyscience.org/article/S0022030216307287/pdf", "status": "HYBRID"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2605827", "name": "C.

To our knowledge, no work has investigated the short-term effects of metritis on feed intake and the long-term consequences on milk yield and risk of culling. The objectives were to determine the effect of metritis on 305-d lactation curves, dry matter intake (DMI), reproduction, and the probability of being culled. Identifying differences in response to metritis between primiparous and multiparous cows was of interest. Milk records were collected twice daily from Holstein cows diagnosed with puerperal metritis (11 primiparous and 16 multiparous) or classified as healthy (14 primiparous and 43 multiparous) during the first 3 wk after calving. Metritic cows were treated at the discretion of the herd veterinarian. Lactation curves of healthy and metritic cows were compared using a mixed model with a Wilmink function. Differences in DMI, days open, and the number of services per conception were assessed using mixed models. The probabilities that cows with and without metritis were not bred, were bred but never confirmed pregnant, or were culled were compared using Fisher's exact tests. Primiparous and multiparous animals were assessed separately. Multiparous cows with metritis produced less milk (35.1\u00b11.5 vs. 39.2\u00b11.0 kg/d), ate less during the 3 wk after calving (12.2\u00b11.2 vs.14.0\u00b10.8 kg/d), and were more likely to be culled (50.0%) than healthy cows (20.9%). The decision to cull was likely influenced by the lower milk yield in early lactation as a result of metritis; the decision to cull was made early, as 7 of the 8 culled metritic cows were not bred. No differences were found in any measurement between primiparous cows with and without metritis. These results indicate that metritis in early lactation has long-term effects on multiparous cows but not primiparous cows.", "year": 2011, "openAccessPdf": {"url": "http://www.journalofdairyscience.org/article/S0022030211002177/pdf", "status": "HYBRID"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "40458960", "name": "J.

Sorted sperm were diluted to 2.1, 3.5, or 5.0 x 10(6) sperm per dose in an egg yolk (20%), Tris, glycerol (7%) extender. Collections were repeated until >600 straws per sperm dose per sire were obtained. Each sperm dose was loaded into color-coded 0.25-mL French straws, with alternate colors used to define treatments across sires. Within sires, straws were packaged at 9 per cane (3 of each color) and strategically allocated to 75 Holstein herds with targets for 50% use in heifers and 50% in lactating cows. Straw color was recorded in the on-farm record-keeping system at the time of insemination. Data were analyzed separately for cows and heifers. Among heifers, a total of 2,125 usable records were retrieved from 51 herds (238 +/- 5.5 services/ sperm dose per sire, range: 218 to 263). Conception rates in heifers were influenced by the sire x sperm dosage interaction. Within sire A, conception rates of heifers were greater for the 5 x 10(6) (59.5%) than for the 2.1 x 10(6) (46.4%) sperm dose and intermediate for the 3.5 x 10(6) sperm dose (52.2%). However, across sires, sperm dosage had no effect on heifer conception rates (46.7, 51.2, and 52.5% for the 2.1, 3.5, and 5.0 x 10(6) sperm dosages, respectively). Among cows, a total of 2,369 services were retrieved from 56 herds (263 +/- 8.8 services/sperm dose per sire, range: 233 to 303). Conception rates of cows (29.4%) were not affected by sire or sperm dosage (27.0, 29.1, and 30.3% for the 2.1, 3.5, and 5.0 x 10(6) sperm dosages, respectively). In conclusion, these data indicate that an increased sperm dosage may enhance virgin heifer conception rates for some (but not all) sires, whereas neither sire nor sexed-sperm dosage affected conception rates of lactating cows. Additional studies of sexed-sperm dosage across a larger sampling of bulls are warranted to determine whether and how such a practice can be implemented cost effectively for the benefit of the dairy industry.", "year": 2008, "openAccessPdf": {"url": "http://www.journalofdairyscience.org/article/S0022030208712141/pdf", "status": "BRONZE"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "7337955", "name": "J.

In Experiment I, 806 cows at 51-57 days post-partum were randomly assigned to a PRID (treated with PRID), PRID-500 (treated with PRID plus 500 IU of eCG) or PRID-750 (treated with PRID plus 750 IU of eCG) group. In Experiment II, 422 cows showing a long anoestrus period (animals with no oestrus signs nor luteal tissue 35 days before treatment) were randomly assigned to the PRID, PRID-500 or PRID-750 groups. The dependent variables considered in binary logistic regression analyses for both experiments were the rates of oestrus, ovulation and conception after treatment, the cumulative conception rate on Day 120 post-partum and pregnancy loss. In Experiment I, interaction between treatment and season showed a significant effect on the oestrous response. Thus, during the warm season, PRID group cows were 8.9 times more likely to express oestrus than the remaining cows. Moreover, inseminated cows with two or more corpora lutea 8-14 days after treatment were more likely to become pregnant (by a factor of 2.4) than cows with a single corpus luteum. Finally, cows without luteal structures treated with PRID were 0.4 less likely to be pregnant on Day 120 post-partum, compared with the remaining cows. In Experiment II, cows in the PRID group treated during the warm or cool season were less likely to exhibit oestrus (by a factor of 0.06 or 0.2, respectively) or ovulate (by a factor of 0.004 or 0.14, respectively) than the remaining cows. In conclusion, in anoestrous cows in both experiments, the addition of eCG to the use of an intravaginal progesterone device to induce oestrus was beneficial.

The data analysed were derived from 1345 lactating cows. Cows between 51 and 57 days postpartum were assigned to the groups: control, PRID (receiving a progesterone-releasing intravaginal device for 9 days, and prostaglandin F(2\u03b1) 24 h before PRID removal) or GnRH-PRID (the same as the PRID group plus GnRH at PRID insertion). Oestrus was detected by using pedometers and confirmed by examination of the genital tract at AI. Oestrous and conception rates before days 71-77 postpartum, pregnancy loss in early pregnant cows or the cumulative conception rate registered on day 120 postpartum were considered as the dependent variables in four consecutive logistic regression analyses. Based on the odds ratios, the oestrous rate increased by a factor of 1.73 in cows showing oestrus before treatment for each unit increase in the number of previous oestruses; decreased by a factor of 0.44 in the control group with respect to the treatment groups; and by a factor of 0.61 in cows without luteal structures at treatment with respect to cows with corpora lutea. The conception rates of cows inseminated before days 71-77 postpartum remained similar across the groups, whereas the likelihood of pregnancy loss for cows becoming pregnant during this period was 0.11 times lower in the PRID group than in the control. Based on the odds ratio, the likelihood of a higher cumulative conception rate on day 120 postpartum: increased in cows showing oestrus before treatment by a factor of 1.41 for each unit increase in the number of previous oestruses, was reduced 0.56-fold in control cows compared with treated cows, and was also reduced by a factor of 0.98 for each kilogram of milk production increase recorded at treatment. In conclusion, although oestrous synchronization programmes performed in this study did not improve fertility, cows treated with progesterone could be inseminated earlier than untreated cows, such that the treatments increased the cumulative pregnancy rates determined on day 120 postpartum. In addition, fewer pregnancy losses were observed in early pregnant cows in the PRID group than the GnRH-PRID group.", "year": 2010, "openAccessPdf": null, "authors": [{"authorId": "1398071668", "name": "I.

The cows were from nine commercial dairy herds in north-eastern Spain.

However, our data show that calving season influenced the interrelationships among reproductive traits. Lactation number was not related to any of the path model variables for cows calving in cool seasons and retained placenta did not directly influence ovarian cysts or repeat breeding. In contrast, older cows that calved during warm seasons showed an increased risk of experiencing retained placenta, ovarian cysts and more days open; retained placenta was a direct risk factor for ovarian cysts and repeat breeding.

Based on survival analysis, although the rate at which cows were inseminated differed among treatments, treatment did not affect the proportion of cows pregnant by 300 DIM. Thus, use of an activity-monitoring system to inseminate cows based on activity reduced days to first AI, whereas cows receiving 100% TAI after completing a Presynch-Ovsynch protocol had more P/AI.

Most heifers (27 of 29) but only 14 of 31 cows had typical spontaneous estrous cycles after cycles were initiated. Twelve cows had atypical cycles, and 5 became anovulatory during the study. The 12 cows with atypical estrous cycles had low serum estradiol after luteolysis and failed to ovulate the dominant follicle present at luteolysis. Heifers and cows with typical cycles were compared directly. Interovulatory intervals were similar between heifers (22.0 +/- 0.4 d) and cows (22.9 +/- 0.7 d). Those animals had estrous cycles with either 2 (15 heifers; 11 cows), 3 (9 heifers; 2 cows), or 4 follicular waves (3 heifers; 1 cow).

To determine whether acquisition of ovulatory capacity is temporally associated with diameter deviation, cows were challenged with purified LH at known times after a GnRH-induced LH surge (experiment 1) or at known follicular diameters (experiments 2 and 3). A 4-mg dose of LH induced ovulation in all cows when the largest follicle was \u226512 mm (16 of 16), in 17% (1 of 6) when it was 11 mm, and no ovulation when it was \u226410 mm (0 of 19). To determine the effect of LH dose on ovulatory capacity, follicular dynamics were monitored every 12 h, and cows received either 4 or 24 mg of LH when the largest follicle first achieved 10 mm in diameter (experiment 2). The proportion of cows ovulating was greater (P < 0.05) for the 24-mg (9 of 13; 69.2%) compared with the 4-mg (1 of 13; 7.7%) LH dose. To determine the effect of a higher LH dose on follicles near diameter deviation, follicular dynamics were monitored every 8 h, and cows received 40 mg of LH when the largest follicle first achieved 7.0, 8.5, or 10.0 mm (experiment 3). No cows with a follicle of 7 mm (0 of 9) or 8.5 mm (0 of 9) ovulated, compared with 80% (8 of 10) of cows with 10-mm follicles. Thus, follicles acquired ovulatory capacity at about 10 mm, corresponding to about 1 day after the start of follicular deviation, but they required a greater LH dose to induce ovulation compared with larger follicles.

Clinical symptoms of this disease include inappetence, tetany, inhibition of urination and defecation, lateral recumbency, and eventual coma and death if left untreated. The hallmark of this disease is severe hypocalcemia, which probably accounts for most of the clinical signs associated with a milk fever episode. Several factors have been consistently associated with increased incidence of milk fever, including parturition and initiation of lactation, advancing age, breed, and diet. Of the various methods used in attempts to control the disease, the most progress has been made in dietary management. Until recently, most attention has focused on manipulating the levels of dietary calcium to control milk fever incidence; results, however, have been inconsistent, except for those diets containing very low (8 to 10 g/d) concentrations of Ca. During the past decade, there has been renewed interest and research in the use of dietary anions (Cl- and SO4(2-) in controlling milk fever. An outgrowth of this research has been the surprising realization that dietary K is significant (perhaps more significant than Ca) in determining the susceptibility of dairy cows to milk fever. This knowledge has expanded the understanding of the pathogenesis of milk fever and has focused attention on research designed to study methods for neutralizing the detrimental effects of dietary K excess on periparturient animal health.

Improvements in fertility are possible by exploiting knowledge about how heat stress affects the reproductive process. The oocyte can be damaged by heat stress at the earliest stages of folliculogenesis and remains sensitive to heat stress in the peri-ovulatory period. Changes in oocyte quality due to heat stress are the result of altered patterns of folliculogenesis and, possibly, direct effects of elevated body temperature on the oocyte. While adverse effects of elevated temperature on the oocyte have been observed in vitro, local cooling of the ovary and protective effects of follicular fluid may limit these actions in vivo. Heat stress can also compromise fertilization rate. The first seven days of embryonic development are very susceptible to disruption by heat stress. During these seven days, the embryo undergoes a rapid change in sensitivity to heat stress from being very sensitive (2- to 4-cell stage) to largely resistant (by the morulae stage). Direct actions of elevated temperature on the embryo are likely to be an important mechanism for reduction in embryonic survival caused by heat stress. An effective way to avoid effects of heat stress on the oocyte, fertilization, and early embryo is to bypass the effects through embryo transfer because embryos are typically transferred into females after acquisition of thermal resistance. There may be some opportunity to mitigate effects of heat stress by feeding antioxidants or regulating the endocrine environment of the cow but neither approach has been reduced to practice. The best long-term solution to the problem of heat stress may be to increase genetic resistance of cows to heat stress. Thermotolerance genes exist within dairy breeds and additional genes can be introgressed from other breeds by traditional means or gene editing.", "year": 2019, "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://www.animal-reproduction.org/article/10.21451/1984-3143-AR2019-0053/pdf/animreprod-16-3-497.pdf", "status": "GOLD"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "145318538", "name": "P.

For instance, heat production of cows yielding 30 kg/day milk is twice as high as maintenance heat production of nonlactating cows, and that of high milk yielding cows giving 55 kg/day is about three times higher than maintenance heat production. Maintenance of normal and constant body temperature requires a balance between endogenous heat produced in the body and the amount of heat lost from the body to the environment. When heat production exceeds heat loss, the body temperature rises. Body temperatures of high milk yielding cows located in a wet region were found to start rising exponentially at air temperatures of 26\u201327 \u00b0C. Thus, even a small rise in air temperature, on the order of 1\u20132 \u00b0C, due, for instance, to global warming, may induce severe hyperthermia in dairy cows. This is clearly seen in Figure 1, which demonstrates the depressive effect of summer heat on the conception rate of lactating cows artificially inseminated (AI) in the summer months over the last 18 years to as low as 27.7%, compared with 42.6% during the cool winter months. Moreover, the \u201cslightly\u201d more severe conditions during the summers of 2010, 2012, and 2015, about 1.5 \u00b0C above average summer air temperatures, further decreased conception by an additional 5% units (Figure 1).", "year": 2018, "openAccessPdf": null, "authors": [{"authorId": "10759764", "name": "D.

The review focuses on the follicle-enclosed oocytes, provides new insights into the cellular and molecular responses of the oocyte to elevated temperature, points out the role of the follicle microenvironment, and discusses some mechanisms that might underlie oocyte impairment. Mechanisms include nuclear and cytoplasmic maturation, mitochondrial function, apoptotic pathways, and oxidative stress.

Commonly, contamination occurs at parturition and to a lesser extent at estrus. Uterine contamination following calving is common, but most healthy cows are able to clear the uterus of bacteria in the first 2 to 3 wk after calving. Persistent infections are more likely to be caused by Actinomyces pyogenes. Specific venereal infections tend to be more host-adapted and produce a lower grade inflammation. Nonspecific bacterial contamination of the endometrium generally induces a neutrophilic influx into the stratum compactum and uterine lumen. Neutrophils phagocytize bacteria with the aid of opsonins in the uterine fluid. Mast cells and eosinophils may also contribute to the inflammatory reaction, which may damage the surface epithelium and release vasoactive substances that allow leakage of serum antibodies into the uterine secretions. Specific antibodies of immunoglobulin (Ig) isotype A, M, G1, and G2 in uterine secretions have been described. In model species, the immune capability of the uterus is influenced by steroid hormones, especially estradiol, which increases secretory component and both IgA and IgG content in uterine secretions and increases the activity of antigen-presenting cells in the uterus.

Expressed as hours-worth of secretion, on average, heifers possessed 25.9 \u00a6 1.5 and cows 33.6 \u00a6 2.9 hours-worth of capacity - data which indicate some potential for reduction in milking frequency without loss of production. Functional udder capacity (l.) was correlated with empty udder volume (tissue volume), and was greater in cows showing high residual milk volumes. The data show that once functional capacity is reached the shut down in milk secretion is rapid, occurring over a 2-4 h period, the rate of accumulation of secretion being constant up to this time.", "year": 1988, "openAccessPdf": null, "authors": [{"authorId": "46903944", "name": "S.

Characteristics of follicle deviation for waves with a single dominant follicle were compared between wave 1 (begins near ovulation; n = 15) and wave 2 (n = 15). Follicles were defined as F1 (largest), F2, and F3, according to maximum diameter. No mean differences were found between waves for follicle diameters at expected deviation (F1, \u22658.5 mm; Hour 0) or observed deviation or in the interval from follicle emergence at 4.0 mm to deviation. For both waves, circulating FSH continued to decrease (P < 0.05) after Hour 0, estradiol began to increase (P < 0.05) at Hour 0, and immunoreactive inhibin began to decrease (P < 0.05) before Hour 0. A transient elevation in circulating LH reached maximum concentration at Hour 0 (P < 0.01) in both waves and was more prominent (P < 0.0001) for wave 1. Waves with codominant follicles (both follicles >10 mm) were more common (P < 0.02) for wave 1 (35%) than for wave 2 (4%). Codominants (n = 6) were associated with more (P < 0.05) follicles \u22654 mm and a greater concentration (P < 0.04) of circulating estradiol at Hours \u221248 to \u22128 than were single dominant follicles (n = 15). A mean transient increase in FSH and LH occurred in the codominant group at Hour \u221224 and may have interfered with deviation of F2. In codominant waves, deviation of F3 occurred near Hour 0 (F1, approximately 8.5 mm). A second deviation involving F2 occurred in four of six waves a mean of 50 h after the F3 deviation and may have resulted from a greater suppression (P < 0.05) of FSH in the codominant group after Hour 0. In conclusion, follicle or hormone differences were similar for waves 1 and 2, indicating that the deviation mechanisms were the same for both waves.

Fifty usable surveys were returned, and the resulting data included qualitative responses regarding facilities, milk recording plans, milk pricing, crossbreeding goals, breed selection, advantages, disadvantages, and future plans. Quantitative variables included producer scores on a 1 to 5 scale for questions regarding ability to fit into the free stalls and milking parlor, milk volume, component percentages, involuntary culling rate, conception rate, calving difficulty, calf mortality, and prices for breeding stock, cull cows, market steers, and bull calves. The most common first generation crosses involved Jersey and Brown Swiss bulls mated to Holstein cows, and backcrosses to one of these parental breeds were most common in the next generation. Producers who responded to this survey desired, and indicated that they achieved, improvements in fertility, calving ease, longevity, and component percentages through crossbreeding. Respondents indicated that crosses involving the Jersey and Brown Swiss breeds had a clear advantage in longevity relative to purebred Holsteins, and conception rates for crosses of Jersey or Brown Swiss sires on Holstein cows were similar to the (high) conception rates typically achieved in purebred Jersey matings. Respondents also indicated that milk composition was improved in the crossbred cattle, but producers cited some difficulties in marketing crossbred breeding stock and bull calves, and noted that the lack of uniformity within the milking herd created management challenges. Based on results of this survey, it appears that crossbreeding can improve the health, fertility, longevity, and profitability of commercial dairy cattle.

Cauterization of the dominant follicle on Day 3 or Day 5 (ovulation on Day 0) (six control and six treated heifers/day) resulted in a surge (P less than 0.05) in FSH beginning the day after cautery. The FSH surge prior to wave 2 (first post-treatment follicular wave) occurred 4 days (Day 3 cautery) and 2 days (Day 5 cautery) before the surge in control groups, corresponding to a 4-day and a 2-day advance in emergence of wave 2 compared with controls. It was concluded that the dominant follicle on Day 3 and Day 5 was associated with the suppression of circulating FSH concentrations. Heifers (n = 4/group) were untreated or treated intravenously with a proteinaceous fraction of bovine follicular fluid on Days 0-3, 3-6, or 6-11. Concentrations of FSH were suppressed (P less than 0.05) for the duration of treatment, regardless of the days of treatment. Cessation of treatment was followed within 1 day by the start of a surge in FSH. The FSH surge prior to wave 2 occurred 2 days earlier (treatment on Days 0-3), 1 day later (treatment on Days 3-6), and 6 days later (treatment on Days 6-11) than in controls, corresponding to an equivalent advance or delay, respectively, in the emergence of wave 2 compared with controls. The results suggest that the effects of exogenous follicular fluid on follicular development were mediated, in whole or in part, by altering plasma FSH concentrations. Control heifers combined for the two experiments were separated into those with 2-wave (n = 11) or 3-wave (n = 5) interovulatory intervals. Two-wave heifers had two FSH surges and 3-wave heifers had three apparent FSH surges during the interovulatory interval. Results of the cautery and follicular fluid experiments indicated that a surge in FSH necessarily preceded the emergence of a wave. The FSH surges in treated and control heifers began 2-4 days before the detectable (ultrasound) emergence of a follicular wave (follicles of 4 and 5 mm), peaked 1 or 2 days before emergence and began to decrease approximately when the follicles of a wave begin to diverge into a dominant follicle and subordinate follicles (follicles 6-7 mm).", "year": 1992, "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://rep.bioscientifica.com/downloadpdf/journals/rep/94/1/jrf_94_1_020.pdf", "status": "BRONZE"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2240790625", "name": "Gregg P.

The aim of this study was to compare dynamics in culling reasons between organic and conventional production and to analyze genotype by environment interactions for longevity. The data contained information from all organic herds with information available from official recording (n=402) and from approximately half of the conventional herds (n=5,335). Records from Swedish Holsteins (n=155,379) and Swedish Red cows (n=160,794) that had their first calf between January 1998 and September 2003 were included. The opportunity period for longevity was at least 6 yr. Six longevity traits were defined: length of productive life; survival through first, second, and third lactations; fertility-determined survival; and udder health-determined survival. Twenty codes were used to describe the cause of culling, and these were divided into 8 groups: udder health, low fertility, low production, leg problems, metabolic diseases, other diseases, other specified causes, and unspecified cause. The main reason for culling cows in organic herds was poor udder health, whereas for cows in conventional herds it was low fertility. Furthermore, the shift in main culling reason from fertility, which was most common in first lactation regardless of production system, to udder health occurred at a lower age in organic production. Heritabilities and genetic correlations for the longevity traits expressed in organic and conventional herds were estimated from a bivariate animal model. The genetic correlations were close to unity (>0.88), except for fertility-determined survival in the Swedish Red breed (0.80). Heritabilities were low to moderate, and no clear pattern was identified for production system or breed.

Different preferences may influence the need for alternative selection indexes for organic production, with different weightings of traits, or a separate breeding program.

And, the first-wave DF is a non-ovulatory follicle, because it develops during the first half of the estrous cycle simultaneously with the corpus luteum (CL), which produces and secretes progesterone. Regarding the characteristics of development and the mechanisms of deviation in the DF during the follicular wave, the first-wave DF has been well studied. However, the characteristics of the first-wave DF, such as growth, blood flow in the follicular wall, concentration of sex steroid hormones in the peripheral blood and follicular fluid, amounts of mRNA in granulosa cells, as well as the characteristics of the CL formed after the first-wave DF and the influence of the first-wave DF on fertility (conception rate), have not been well studied. Additionally, the first-wave DF synthesizes and secretes 17\u03b2-estradiol (E2), and plasma E2 concentration increases during the early stage of the estrous cycle. Consequently, there is a possibility that the first-wave DF might affect the fertility in cattle. In this review, to provide the new perspective on reproductive physiology in cattle, characteristics of the first-wave DF were examined in detail and its characteristics were compared with that of the second-wave DF.

In 2015, there were over 13.7 million artificial inseminations (AI), of which, about 77% were carried out using fixed-time AI (FTAI). This technology has helped to substantially improve reproductive efficiency in beef and dairy cattle. In relation to embryo transfer, production of in vivo derived (IVD) embryos remained relatively stable, with average production of 30-40,000 embryos per year, whereas in vitro production (IVP) of embryos had a substantial increase, from about 12,500 IVP embryos in 2000 to more than 300,000 IVP embryos after 2010. The increasing availability and use of sex-sorted sperm was one of the factors responsible for a recent shift from the predominance of IVP embryos from beef breeds to dairy breeds in Brazil. Moreover, there was also an increase from 13% in 2014 to 29% in 2015 in the percentage of vitrified/frozen embryos. Moreover, the successful use of protocols for fixed-time ET (FTET) due to their high efficiency and ease of implementation, has facilitated the dissemination of ET programs all over Brazil. However, there is room for improvement, since there are several reports of high pregnancy loss and high peripartum loss, when IVP embryos are used.

The endocrine factor(s) responsible for increased milk yield, however, has eluded identification. Recent studies suggest that insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) may mediate the galactopoietic response to long day photoperiod. Indeed, long days increase IGF-I in heifers and lactating cows; in the latter case, the response preceded an increase in milk yield. In heifers and cows, the increase in IGF-I is independent of changes in circulating growth hormone. Melatonin feeding to mimic a short-day photoperiod suppressed the increase of IGF-I in heifers induced by long days. However, melatonin feeding had no effect on milk yield in cows. Despite lack of resolution of the endocrine mechanism, dairy producers are interested in how photoperiod management can be integrated with current practices throughout the lactation cycle. There is strong evidence that milk yield responses to long days persist through an entire lactation. Also, long days can be combined with bovine somatotropin (bST) to produce additive increases in milk yield. During the dry period, long days increase the periparturient surge of prolactin. However, relative to long days, short-day treatment during the dry period produces the largest magnitude of response in milk yield during the subsequent lactation. The response to short days during the dry period may be due to a priming effect on the photoperiodic response system. In summary, IGF-I has emerged as a possible mediator of the increase of milk yield in response to long-day photoperiod. Photoperiod can be combined effectively with other management techniques such as bST. Consideration of photoperiod management during the dry period is essential to maximize responses during the subsequent lactation.", "year": 2000, "openAccessPdf": null, "authors": [{"authorId": "2723152", "name": "G.

The relationships between health, fertility and yield and body condition score were examined by using multiple logistic regressions for measurements with only two outcomes and general linear models for the continuous variables. Herds, parity, season, length of dry period, postparturient diseases, twinning, stillbirth, induction of calving and high somatic cell counts were used as confounding and other exposure variables. Multiparous cows that were underconditioned at calving were culled and exhibited more postparturient uterine diseases. The risk of retained placenta was greater for cows that were underconditioned at drying off, whereas cows that lost more body condition during the dry period suffered more from both retained placenta and metritis; the two effects being independent of each other. An apparent increase in the risk of ketosis associated with overconditioning at calving could be partly attributed to long dry periods. Cows with a higher condition score at calving were less prone to anoestrus but did not conceive more successfully to first service. A reduction of six open days in primiparous cows was estimated for each additional unit of body condition score at calving. Multiparous cows that lost more body condition during the dry period suffered more from inactive ovaries and were more likely to be open 150 days after calving in the next lactation.

The Ovsynch protocol included injections of GnRH 7 d before and 48 h after an injection of PGF20. Timed artificial insemination (TAI; 57 to 77 d postpartum) was 16 to 20 h after the second GnRH injection.

Cycling Holstein heifers (n = 24) were injected twice with prostaglandin F2alpha to induce estrus and were scanned by ovarian ultrasonography to determine the day of ovulation (d 0). Heifers were assigned to initiate the Ovsynch/TAI protocol at d 2 (n = 5), 5 (n = 5), 10 (n = 4), 15 (n = 5), or 18 (n = 5) of the cycle. The Ovsynch/TAI was initiated with an injection of gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist followed 7 d later with an injection of prostaglandin F2alpha. At 36 h after injection of prostaglandin F2alpha, heifers were injected with gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist and inseminated 16 h later. Heifers were scanned daily during the Ovsynch/TAI protocol and every other day after insemination until 16 d later. Blood samples were collected daily starting at the 1st day heifers were scanned and continued until 16 d after insemination. Initiation of the Ovsynch/TAI protocol at d 15 of the estrous cycle caused heifers to ovulate prior to insemination. A shortened return to estrus (< 16 d) was caused by ovulation failure to the second gonadotropin-releasing hormone injection, by incomplete regression of the corpus luteum, and by short life-span of the induced corpus luteum. Day of the cycle in which the Ovsynch/TAI protocol is initiated affects dynamics of follicular development, plasma progesterone profiles, and occurrence of premature ovulation. Size of the pre-ovulatory follicle was associated positively with subsequent progesterone concentrations following insemination.", "year": 2000, "openAccessPdf": null, "authors": [{"authorId": "49886273", "name": "F.

METHODS: Data were retrospectively collected for 2652 cows from 11 herds on the occurrence of periparturient diseases and condition, calving date, age and treatment for anoestrus prior to the planned start of mating (PSM). The effects of each disease or condition on submission and pregnancy rate by 28 days after PSM, final pregnancy rate, and the proportion of cows that conceived more than 50 days after PSM were examined using separate logistic regression models. Results are expressed as odds ratios (OR). Additionally, the effect of each disease or condition on the interval from PSM to conception was examined using survival analysis. Age, herd and late calving (i.e. cows calved \u226440 days before PSM) were included as factors in the models examined. RESULTS: Induction of parturition increased the risk of RFM (OR=3.3, p<0.01). The 28-day submission rate was affected by age and herd but not by any of the periparturient conditions examined. The 28-day pregnancy rate was reduced by RFM (OR=0.04, p<0.05), induction of parturition (OR=0.67, p<0.01), assisted calving (OR=0.61, p<0.01), late calving (OR=0.55, p<0.05) and anoestrus (OR=0.27, p<0.05). The final pregnancy rate was reduced by RFM (OR=0.013, p<0.01), induction (OR=0.25, p<0.05), assisted calving (OR=0.30, p<0.005) and anoestrus (OR=0.32, p<0.05), and was increased if the cow was submitted for mating within 28 days after PSM (OR=2.72, p<0.05). Effects of recumbency and twinning were not significant in any of the models. CONCLUSIONS: Cows that had had RFM or were assisted, induced or late to calve, had significantly lower pregnancy rates or took longer to conceive than unaffected herd-mates. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Intervention programs aimed at the examination and treatment of cows with periparturient conditions may improve the reproductive performance of New Zealand dairy herds. Investigations of poor reproductive performance of a herd should include analysis of the prevalence and effects of periparturient diseases and conditions.", "year": 2001, "openAccessPdf": null, "authors": [{"authorId": "145241442", "name": "S.

The current population of high-producing dairy cows is considered to be subfertile, as characterized by low pregnancy rates and high rates of embryonic mortality. Coordinated systems of reproductive management have been developed based upon a thorough understanding of the endocrine, cellular, and molecular factors controlling ovarian and uterine function. These systems will partially restore herd reproductive performance. Advances in other reproductive technologies offer possibilities for wider use of superior germplasm. Technologies such as sexed semen, cloning, transgenesis, and preimplantation genetic diagnosis offer the potential to enhance the influence of superior animals on production of food for human consumption. However, at this time, additional research is needed to counteract the higher rates of embryonic and fetal mortality associated with some of these technologies. Furthermore, use of genomics, proteomics, and bioinformatics in the study of reproduction will undoubtedly provide investigators with a greater understanding of the limitations to efficient reproductive processes in the subfertile lactating dairy cow.", "year": 2006, "openAccessPdf": {"url": "http://www.journalofdairyscience.org/article/S0022030206721944/pdf", "status": "HYBRID"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2112423780", "name": "K.

Foetal defects and stillbirth were quite frequent, and the calves affected were fathered by 56 sires.

The model was based on the marginal net revenue technique. Inputs for the model can be entered for specific farm conditions, and the output is easily accessible. In the model, the retention pay-off (RPO) value of individual dairy cows was calculated. The RPO value of a cow is equal to the total additional profits that a producer can expect from trying to keep the cow until her optimal age, taking into account the changes of involuntary removal compared with her immediate replacement. To calculate the RPO values, the future production, revenues, and costs of dairy cows at different levels of milk production with different numbers of days open (DO) were determined. Furthermore, the ranges of carcass value, calf revenues, and the range of involuntary disposal rates of cows within and across lactations were taken into account. To illustrate the model, parameters in the model were chosen to represent a typical Holstein dairy herd in Pennsylvania. The results of this model are very comparable with earlier, more complex models that are more difficult to use on the farm. In addition to using the RPO values to evaluate the decision to breed or replace a cow, the costs per additional DO were estimated. Early conception was most profitable with the costs per additional DO varying from $0 to more than $3/d. The model can be used as a decision-supporting tool for producers, extension personnel, veterinarians, and consultants. In addition, researchers, economists, and government organizations can use the model to determine the costs of culling dairy cows in a disease control program.

Prenatal losses occur due to early embryonic mortality (about 40%), later embryo loss (up to 20% in high-yielding herds) or abortion (about 5%). A recent survey of 19 UK herds showed that 7.9% of calves were born dead and 3.4% died within 1 month. During the rearing phase, 6.7% of animals were lost before reaching first service at 15 months due to disease or accident and another 2.3% failed to conceive. Many potential replacements therefore never enter the milking herd. This severely limits opportunities for on-farm selection of breeding cows in addition to presenting a welfare issue and causing economic loss. The most profitable animals once lactation is reached combine good milk production with a regular calving pattern. Some aspects of performance are related to age at first calving (AFC), which in turn is influenced by heifer growth rates. Poorly growing animals required more services to conceive, calved later and subsequently performed badly. Optimum fertility and maximum yield in the first lactation were associated with an AFC of 24 to 25 months. However, heifers calving at 22 to 23 months performed best in terms of total milk yield and survival over the first 5 years, partly because good heifer fertility was associated with better fertility later. We have investigated some possible juvenile predictors of future performance. Low-birth-weight calves were more likely to come from either primiparous mothers or older dams (3+ lactations) with higher peak milk yields, suggesting that the uterine environment may limit prenatal calf growth due to competition for nutrients with maternal growth or milk production. Linear trait classification scores for frame size show genetic correlations with longevity. The skeletal measures of height and crown rump length in 1-month-old calves was correlated to subsequent stature, and frame size was correlated to weight at 15 months. It may thus be possible to predict performance from simple size measurements as juveniles. Neither endogenous nor stimulated growth hormone (GH) release in 6-month-old calves were related to milk yield in the first three lactations, but size of a stimulated GH peak was positively related to milk energy values in the first lactation. Cows with delayed ovulation (>45 days) in the first lactation had a higher GH pulse amplitude and lower IGF-I as a juvenile. Cows that partition excess energy into milk in their first lactation may suffer reduced longevity.", "year": 2008, "openAccessPdf": null, "authors": [{"authorId": "5108865", "name": "D.

However, one typical freemartin also had 0% XY (100% XX) Karyotypes in 300 cells when examined at three ages. Overall, 18 freemartins examined at 1, 24, and 52 weeks of age averaged 60.7%, 57.9%, and 55.5% XY cells, respectively (P greater than 0.05). No systematic relationship was found between the proportion of XY cells and the abnormalities of the reproductive organs, as judged by vaginal depth and clitoral development at 1, 24, and 52 weeks, and examination of the reproductive organs per rectum at 54 weeks of age. The clitoris of untreated freemartins and those treated with estrone or estradiol postnatally did not enlarge. Testosterone treatment caused enlargement. None of the hormones affected vaginal depth. These studies provide convincing evidence that the blood lymphocyte XX:XY karyotype ratio (1) is not related to the degree of masculinization and (2) is stabile in the postnatal freemartin. Thirdly, the freemartin reproductive organs do not respond to common sex-steroid hormones postnatally other than the clitoral response to testosterone.", "year": 1977, "openAccessPdf": null, "authors": [{"authorId": "10091268", "name": "W.
